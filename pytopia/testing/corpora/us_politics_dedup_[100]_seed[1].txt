Here Are The Lives They Lived., url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/18/isis-christians-killed-_n_6703278.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics, datepublished=2015-02-18 22:56:39, date=2015-02-18 23:56:55.140000, datesaved=2015-02-18 23:56:55.140000, text=AL AOUR, Egypt -- Death is everywhere in Al Aour. When a video surfaced late Sunday showing Islamic State fighters beheading 21 men in Libya, it seemed no family here was spared. Thirteen of the victims hailed from this dusty Egyptian town, roughly three hours south of Cairo.  The men were laborers, gone for months on end, who sent home hard-earned money to feed entire families. They left their impoverished home in Egypt to work in Libya for a better future, despite the dangers. What they found instead was a militant group hell-bent on humiliating and harming them because they were Christian. While most of the people killed by the Islamic State have been Muslim, the group's recent propaganda video made a point to threaten Christianity as a religion. The fact that the 21 men were Egyptian made them even more sought-out targets: citizens of a country cracking down on Islamists both within its own borders and inside Libya.  On Jan. 3 at around 2:30 a.m. in the coastal Libyan city of Sirte, masked gunmen began knocking on doors, according to survivors. They were looking for Christians marked with traditional tattoos on their hands that identified them as Copts, an ancient Christian sect in Egypt. Some men were pulled from their beds at gunpoint. Others hid and prayed, only to later see their captured friends and family members decapitated in a widely circulated and highly produced Islamic State video.  But in this tight-knit village, these men will not be remembered for their brutal murders. They are remembered as beloved husbands, sons, brothers, cousins and friends. In death, their lives are celebrated.  Here are the lives they lived, as told by family members.     Magda Aziz, 29, holds the photo of her late husband, killed by ISIS, as she sits in her home in Al Aour, Egypt, on Tuesday.  Hani loved his four children -- three girls and a boy, the youngest -- more than anything in the world, his family says. He was gentle and kind, always making a joke whenever he could. His wife Magda Aziz, 29, will forever remember his laugh.  "I felt like he was an angel," Magda said of her deeply devout husband. "There was a prayer in anything he said."  Hani desperately wanted to come home after eight months laboring in Libya. He was sick and tired of the relentless violence and the constant threat of kidnapping. But leaving was a difficult choice. There was money in Libya, unlike in Al Aour, money that he needed to support Magda and his children. But he finally decided to come home to his family, she said. He was killed before he ever got a chance to leave.  "He took care of all of us," Magda explains, weakly. The women around her nod in unison, passing around a faded photograph of the smiling father with his little boy.  "He was so kind," Magda says. "He gave us hugs and kisses."     Hani Abdel Messihah, 32, killed by ISIS in Libya, smiles with his young son in a worn photograph.  Magda will never forget the last conversation she had with her husband. He called on New Year's wanting to speak with each of his children. The couple exchanged tender words. He asked if she wanted or needed anything -- he would try to get it to her, whatever it was. She remembers saying, "I want you safe." And he asked her to pray for him. She never heard from Hani again.  When she saw the video of his beheading on Egyptian television, her family cried so hard that she says neighbors called an ambulance. She doesn't talk much about how she feels now, apart from the fact that she's still in shock.  "I miss him," she says with a whisper.  Her three daughters sit around her, clinging to their mother. The oldest girl begins to weep as the younger two stare off, unable to comprehend the grief around them.  "Your dad is in the sky," a relative says, hoping to console the little girl. "He's in the heavens."     Shmouda Shoukry holds up a photo of his brother of Yousef Shoukry (pictured right), a 24-year-old Coptic Christian beheaded by the Islamic State.  Yousef was a quiet young man with the heart of a child, his family says. All he wanted to do was find a job and start a family.  But after leaving the army after high school, there were few job prospects. He couldn't live the life he wanted, his mother, Theresa, recalls, sitting in her home surrounded by family.  But the Libyan border wasn't too far, and many men before Yousef had gone to work there already. He decided to leave Egypt. His mother begged him not to go, but he wouldn't listen. She says that his faith gave him the courage to go to Libya in the face of danger. "I have one God, he's the same here and there," she remembers Yousef saying.     A mother and son mourn the loss of Yousef Shoukry.  A steady stream of women walk into the room, all dressed in black. They reach out to comfort the grieving mother.  "He's a martyr," she says, holding her cross close to her heart. "I know he's in a better place."  Everyone in the family looked up to Yousef. His sister says he was curious and always in good spirits, despite the family's hard circumstances.  His older brother, Shmouda, 27, the middle brother of four, says he has was always proud of him.  "He lived according to the book," he said, holding a photo of Yousef as a young soldier. "I can't remember something he did wrong."  Yousef always joked with Shmouda to hurry up and get married so it could be his turn. He was saving up to support a family.  The last time the family spoke with Yousef was when he called on New Year's. "I told him I'd pray for him," she remembers. "I said: 'May God make your life easier.'"  Theresa refused to watch the video showing her son beheaded. But her other son says he made himself watch it.  "I saw that he had strength in his last moments," the 27-year-old man said, insisting that there was a heavenly light shining on his brother's face, even after he was decapitated. "And that consoled me."     A Coptic Christian man holds up the ID of his brother, Towadros Yousef, who was murdered by the Islamic State.  Long before he was murdered by extremists, Towadros was sacrificing so that his family could live better lives. A year and a half ago, he traveled from his village of Al Aour to Libya. Far from the comfort and safety of home, the 42-year-old father of three -- two boys and a girl -- labored away to provide for his family.  He was an introvert, the quiet one in the room. "He wasn't one of make a lot of noise about anything," his brother remembers, smiling. But he was a fighter, determined to give his children a better life than he had.  "He was a really hard worker," his older brother, Bebawi Yousef, 34, says, sitting in the pew of a small church in Al Aour. "He loved working."  Life in Libya was difficult, to say the least, but it was worth it for Towadros to put food on his family's table. He was a family man, above all else.  "He was happiest being with his family and kids," Bebawi says fondly. "He was a kind person."     Bebawi Yousef sits in a pew at the church in Al Aour, Egypt, on Tuesday during a ceremony mourning the loss of 21 Coptic Christians, including his older brother, who were murdered by ISIS.  Bebawi remembers his last conversation with his brother with regret. Towadros called to see how everyone was and he said he wanted to come home, finally. He was ready. The doting father was worried that something bad would happen to him and he wouldn't be able to support his family anymore.  "We told him to wait," Bebawi recalls. "Because they were targeting Christians. We said, 'If you come now at New Year's, it's dangerous.'" The family thought he was safer staying put than traveling on the dangerous roads back to Egypt.  Up until the last moment, Bebawi was ready to do anything to help save his brother. He traveled from Al-Aour to Cairo to talk on an Egyptian television show to raise awareness about the case of the kidnapped Copts. Five minutes before going on air, he received the fateful call from his local priest.  "My condolences," Bebawi remembers him saying. "It's over. They've passed."  He can't believe that Towadros is gone. "I was trying to hold onto the last bit of hope," he says somberly.     Maged Suleiman Shahata, 40     The brother of Maged Suleiman Shahata, a Coptic Christian killed by ISIS, shows a photo of his brother's ID card at a church in Al Aour, Egypt, on Tuesday.  Maged was born into poverty and so were his children. But the father of three was determined to change their futures.  "My brother, they way they lived," he said, shaking his head at the family's poverty. "It was him and his wife and three children in one room together."  "That's how hard life is here," he said, sitting in a Coptic Church surrounded by mourners. "That's how hard he worked. He was fed up with having no money. There is no work in the south."  Maged ventured to Libya, like many others from his village, hoping to earn enough money to change his family's life. Maged was proud that despite their poor financial situation, his oldest daughter was in college. It made the long, hard, dangerous work in Libya worth everything.     Emat Suleiman Shahta mourns the loss of his brother who was beheaded by ISIS.  Emad spoke with his brother just hours before he was kidnapped. He asked Maged about another group of Christians who had just been snatched up by ISIS, worried that it could happen to him, too. Maged's last words to him, he painfully remembers, were that his phone credit was out. "I didn't know what that would mean," he said, upset that he didn't get a chance to say goodbye or tell him how much he meant to him.  "He was a very sweet man," Emad said. "Easily embarrassed."  Emad mourns his brother's death, but he isn't consumed with hatred. Instead, he looks past the senseless killing and finds hope in his belief that Maged and the other 20 men are now in a safe place where no one can hurt them.  "We are proud that they went to the father in the sky," he said with a warm smile.     A banner showing the faces of Coptic Christians killed by ISIS hangs from the painted ceiling of the Coptic Church in Al Aour, Egypt, on Tuesday.  Here are the names of the rest of the Christian men killed by the Islamic State in Libya, according to a list provided to The WorldPost by a Coptic church representative in Minya.  5.

Obama's executive actions, which would permit as many as 5 million people who are in the U.S. illegally to remain here, were put on hold by a preliminary injunction issued last month by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas.  The injunction was issued at the request of a coalition of 26 states, led by Texas that filed a lawsuit to overturn Obama's immigration plan. The states argue Obama's action was unconstitutional.  The Justice Department earlier this month filed an emergency motion with the 5th Circuit, asking it to lift Hanen's preliminary injunction, arguing the order interferes with the Homeland Security Department's ability to protect the country and "secure our borders."  The states say they will suffer irreversible economic harm if the injunction is lifted.  The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said each side will have an hour to make their arguments about the injunction during the April hearing.  The scheduling of the hearing was part of a court order that granted a request by the Justice Department to expedite its appeal of Hanen's Feb. 16 ruling.  The Justice Department had asked Hanen to lift the injunction while the case was appealed to the 5th Circuit. But Hanen put that request on hold until he heard from federal prosecutors about allegations that the U.S. government had misled him about the implementation of part of the immigration plan.  During a court hearing last week, a Justice Department attorney apologized to Hanen for any confusion about how more than 108,000 people received three-year reprieves from deportation before the judge made a decision on the injunction.  Hanen has yet to decide if he will issue sanctions against the Justice Department if he decides that the U.S. government had begun implementing an expansion of a program that protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.  The other states seeking to block Obama's orders are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

It was 2006, and the newspaper had just run an exclusive story on a government program that tracked terrorist financing. Cotton, not yet 30, was serving with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq. He started with a wry apology for "not writing sooner," then lit the blowtorch.  "You may think you have done a public service," Cotton railed at the Times, "but you have gravely endangered the lives of my soldiers and all other soldiers and innocent Iraqis here. Next time I hear that familiar explosion—or next time I feel it—I will wonder whether we could have stopped that bomb had you not instructed terrorists how to evade our financial surveillance.  The letter was not published. It went viral instead. Conservative blogs, starting with Powerline—then still famous for its role in destroying Dan Rather's career over his fraudulent report on George W. Bush's National Guard service—published Cotton's demolition job. Cotton's language was so perfect that the conspiracy-debunking website Snopes ended up publishing a story about how, yes, a real soldier really wrote it.  "Much discussion has since ensued over whether Lt. Cotton is a real person (especially since 'Tom Cotton' is also the name of a Hobbit who appears in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings)," the website wrote at the time.  Six years later, Cotton won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, and last year he bulldozed Democratic dynast Mark Pryor to win a Senate seat. One month into the new job, he's gone viral again, with a line of questioning at Thursday morning's hearing on the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Arizona Senator John McCain, the new Armed Services chairman, had recently reversed course and turned against the Obama administration's campaign to close the facility. That denied Democrats a credible, war-scarred Republican voice. And when Cotton took his turn questioning Brian McKeon, principal deputy undersecretary for policy at the Department of Defense, Democrats learned that they'd gained a fierce Republican critic.  COTTON: I want to explore the so-called risk balance between recidivism of released terrorists and the propaganda value that terrorists get from Guantanamo Bay. How many recidivists are there at Guantanamo Bay right now? MCKEON: I'm not sure I follow the question. COTTON: How many detainees in Guantanamo Bay are engaging in terrorism or anti- American excitement? COTTON: ... because they're detained, because they only engage in that kind of recidivism overseas. Now let's look at the propaganda value. How many detainees were at Guantanamo Bay on September 11, 2001? COTTON: How many were there in October 2000 when al Qaeda bombed the USS Cole? COTTON: What about in 1998, when they bombed our embassies? MCKEON: The facility was not open before 2002, Senator. COTTON: In 1993 in the first World Trade Center bombing. COTTON: In 1979, when Iran took over our embassy? In 1983, when Hezbollah bombed our embassy and our Marine barracks in Lebanon? The answer is zero. COTTON: Islamic terrorists don't need an excuse to attack the United States. They don't attack us for what we do, they attack us for who we are. It is not a security decision. It is a political decision based on a promise the president made on his campaign. To say that it is a security decision based on propaganda value that our enemies get from it is a pretext to justify a political decision. In my opinion, the only problem of Guantanamo Bay is there are too many empty beds and cells there right now. We should be sending more terrorists there for further interrogation to keep this country safe. As far as I'm concerned, every last one of them can rot in hell, but as long as they don't do that, then they can rot in Guantanamo Bay!  The Cotton video was quickly posted by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news site that had previously listed "killing a terrorist" in a round-up of "what it means to be a man." The WFB story was shared more than 2000 times on Facebook; write-ups in The Huffington Post and progressive sites didn't burn quite as hot. It took until the late afternoon for Vox to capture the video, describing Cotton's moment as "bizarre rant," while the site's content director surmised that the senator "appears to be on large amounts of drugs."  Cotton's colleagues in the Senate didn't really push back. West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who has not ruled out running for the governor's office he used to hold, admitted that he "had really the same feeling that Senator Cotton had for a lot of years," before admitting that he wanted to transfer prisoners. Cotton had blown up the debate, though—instead of concerning whether the prisoners could live out their sentences in the continental United States, it had become about whether the people who questioned GTMO were excusing terrorism.  "What I do not want to see, and all of us should be able to agree on this, that we do not want to see detainees from GTMO being released and returning to the fight," said Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican and Iraq War veteran elected in 2013. "My sentiments are exactly like Senator Cotton's. I could care less. They really should not be out there where they can threaten American lives or our NATO allies, their lives."

id=153579, title=Quick Answers To Double Shooting Elude Police In Ferguson\, Missouri, url=http://www.ibtimes.com/quick-answers-double-shooting-elude-police-ferguson-missouri-1847140, datepublished=2015-03-14 14:04:32, date=2015-03-14 14:27:43.203000, datesaved=2015-03-14 14:27:43.203000, text=(Reuters) - Nearly 48 hours after two officers were shot in Ferguson, Missouri, investigators had dozens of leads but no arrests to report on Friday in the hunt for a gunman who turned a late-night protest against police into bedlam.  St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said authorities had "a pretty good idea" where the gunshots that wounded the officers had originated, without providing specifics, but added that an arrest was not imminent.  The kind of gun used, the shooter's motivation and any connection to the protesters remained a mystery, prolonging uncertainty for a town that has come to symbolize America's struggle with race and policing.  The latest bout of violence in the St. Louis suburb, first rattled by the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white officer last summer, brought out signs of sympathy for police on Friday.  One protester stood opposite the Ferguson police department with a sign reading "Cops Lives Matter," playing on the "Black Lives Matter" slogan that sprang up in the wake of police killings of unarmed black men in New York City and elsewhere.  Belmar said donations for rewards to help the investigation had poured in over the last two days.  The desire of some to move on from months of racial strife and protests played out in a chilly evening rain in front of the police department on Friday, where a dozen mostly white residents stood holding signs reading "I [heart] Ferguson.”  "Obviously we have a lot of changes to make, but we're very resilient and committed to do what's right," said Susan Ankenbrand, 72, a tour guide in St Louis and Ferguson resident for 40 years.  "But we want to put another face on our community."  Though others, like The Organization for Black Struggle Executive Director Montague Simmons, are determined to continue the near-daily demonstrations.  "Some people are sick of it, sure," Simmons said. "At the same time, others want us because of the change we bring."  To that end, five residents signed an affidavit at Ferguson City Hall Friday afternoon to start a petition for Mayor James Knowles' recall, according to a statement from The Organization for Black Struggle.  Residents will have 60 days to gather signatures from 15 percent of registered voters in the last mayoral election to prompt a special election, the statement said.  Ferguson's police chief, city manager, municipal court judge and two police officers have resigned since the U.S. Justice Department released a damning review last week of the police force in Ferguson, where a majority of residents are African-American and most of the police are white.  The report found that the force overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to black residents, creating a "toxic" environment with its policing practices.  But Knowles said on Friday that it would be up to voters to remove him.  "Somebody here has to be left standing to make sure the government continues to operate. There are ways to get rid of me as mayor," Knowles said in an interview with National Public Radio.  Knowles, whose job as mayor is part-time, told NPR, "I'm giving it every last measure at this point and I will continue to do so, as long as the citizens will have me."  In Thursday's shooting, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old colleague from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound that left a bullet lodged near his ear. Both were treated and released by a local hospital.  The shooting of the officers came less than three months after the killing of two New York City patrolmen by a troubled man who said he was seeking to avenge the deaths at the hands of police of Brown and Eric Garner in New York.  The latest turn of events threatened to undermine an incipient recovery in the town of 21,000, where an injection of funds has helped small businesses rebuild after two spates of looting and vandalism last year.  President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, who both have been critical of city leaders and police in Ferguson, called the assailants "criminals" and "punks" on Thursday.

This standard of "trust" can be traced directly to the late Walter Cronkite of CBS whose long experience as a wartime reporter, coupled with his avuncular voice, cadence and demeanor, conveyed not only gravitas but also reliability and honesty. When you listen to someone who ends each broadcast with "And that's the way it is, Wednesday, February 24, 1971 ..." you come away thinking ... well, that's the way it really was. Walter Cronkite, whom I had the good fortune of meeting once, was the original Voice of God.  Since Cronkite retired in 1981, no anchor has succeeded in commanding the same level of respect and trust. Some, like Tom Brokaw (NBC) and Peter Jennings (ABC), have come close, and Dan Rather, Cronkite's immediate successor at CBS, lost his anchor's perch after 24 years over a flawed 60 Minutes segment on George W. Bush's National Guard service.  It is also apparent that today's third generation of network anchors has brought to the job a combination of good reporting skills and experience, along with evolving personas as hip celebrities who must also find ways to cope with the overall declining ratings for network news programs. It is not an accident that many of the commercials aired during the network news programs are targeted at an over-50 audience that presumably suffers from a cornucopia of illnesses. (Why do those ads for erectile dysfunction conclude with the happy couple holding hands in two separate tubs?)  To help reach a younger audience, Brian Williams had developed a second career as a late-night comic, and David Muir, ABC's new anchor who succeeded Diane Sawyer, is occasionally seen reporting in open-necked shirts or skin-tight Tees that undoubtedly bring a new degree of muscularity to his work. Like almost every other aspect of American culture, the nightly news has now become a commodity driven by audience share, advertising revenues, and the celebrity attraction of the people who read the news.  The response to the six-month suspension of Brian Williams has been fascinating to watch. I do not know Mr. Williams, but he has always struck me as a serious and decent man, but in this case, there can be little doubt that he made mistakes in exaggerating his own experience in a dangerous war zone. Americans, however, tend to be forgiving people, and one unresolved issue here is whether his error is so serious that he must ultimately lose his job. We'll see later this year.  Search firm professionals have told me over the years that it is surprising the number of resumes they see from professionals that include lies, especially tall tales that misrepresent one's education. I know one former CEO who lied on his resume: he stated that he had an M.B.A when, in fact, he didn't. When this untruth surfaced, his board did not fire him but, instead, docked him a $1 million annual bonus. Other executives have been fired for similar indiscretions. Each case will be different, and there is no magic formula for handling these problems. The tension between forgiveness on the one hand and losing a job on the other hand will continue to play itself out on a case-by-case basis.  But here's my real concern about the Brian Williams episode: It has prompted the wrong debate. The real debate, in my view, is why our network news programs are so shallow, so focused on what Rush Limbaugh and others call "low information" voters. Why is international coverage so thin? Do we need to have so many lost-animal stories when there's an economic crisis in Greece, an ongoing war in Ukraine, uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy, and a rising global Islamic jihad?  The anchors of our network news programs have become little more than readers of scripts. When they read the evening news to us, they are not reporting. Backing up their scripts is an army of people who do the selecting and the writing for what eventually appears on the screen. Shouldn't the concept of trust also apply to these people as well? Is it possible to hold accountable these behind-the-scenes people who play a major role in deciding what news gets reported?  There are obvious limitations imposed by a program format that is limited to 30 minutes (including advertisements), but there are other programs that offer better substance, variety, and depth than the network news. PBS's News Hour, for example, provides excellent international and economic coverage while also offering an occasional human-interest feature story. Likewise, French television provides almost an hour of commercial-free coverage that offers in-depth national and international information.  Our main network news programs can do better. They do not need celebrity anchors -- they need better content. Low-information news programs beget low-information citizens. Rather than dumb down the evening news, why not expand it with more in-depth coverage of the most important domestic and international stories?  When Walter Cronkite delivered the evening news, there were only three major networks. Today, we have an explosion of news sources -- on television, radio, the Internet, and social media. "Aggregators" like newspapers and the television networks face enormous competitive pressures at a time when the news itself has become disaggregated. People now tend to find their news from several different sources and at different times throughout the day.

John Lewis of Georgia, G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina and Earl Blumenauer of Oregon said on Thursday that they won't attend Netanyahu's March 3 speech, according to media reports.  Lewis, a leader of the American Civil Rights Movement, reportedly said that he has “no plans to attend the speech,” adding that Boehner’s unilateral invitation to Netanyahu was “an affront to the president and the state department.”  Butterfield and Blumenauer also accused Boehner of indulging in “political grandstanding” and attempting to “unnecessarily politicize” America’s relations with Israel, according to media reports.  “It is baffling that Speaker Boehner, who incessantly proclaims executive overreach by the president, would buck long standing diplomatic protocol to extend such an invitation,” Butterfield reportedly said.  Dianne Feinstein, another senior Democrat and former head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, on Thursday that she had still not decided whether to attend the “obviously political” speech, according to media reports. Several other Democrats also said they were weighing the decision to show up for the speech.  Boehner’s decision to invite Netanyahu has also angered the White House, which announced in January that the President would not meet Netanyahu during his Washington visit. Netanyahu, who shares a frosty relation with Obama, is also expected to speak in support of imposing renewed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. However, Obama has said he would veto any attempts to impose further sanctions on Iran.  Responding to a question over reports of several Democrats skipping the speech, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, on Wednesday, that the President believes “it is up to individual members of Congress to make their own decision about whether or not to attend.”  Netanyahu has also faced backlash by Israeli diplomats for his decision to accept Boehner’s invitation, according to media reports. On Thursday, the Israeli ambassador to Switzerland and a diplomat to India were recalled over comments critical of the Prime Minister.

The President assembled black leadership to elaborate on his administration's priorities as described in the State of the Union Address last month and as a wrap-up of a Black History Month series of events at the White House.  It was an honor to represent the National Black Farmers Association and to be included in the discussion with President Obama, Rev. Al Sharpton of the National Action Network, Marc Morial, head of the National Urban League and others. (A complete list can be found here.)  In addition to highlighting the upcoming release of a special report from his Task Force on 21st Century Policing, President Obama spoke about his project targeting young males of color, the My Brother's Keeper Initiative, and continuing efforts to reduce restrictions to voting.  Cabinet secretaries who commented during the talks included Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez and from the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.  The wide-ranging topics on the agenda at the White House covered particularly acute concerns over high rates of heart attacks, stroke and diabetes among African Americans and criminal justice problems of disproportionate levels of imprisonment and lethal use of police force to name a few.  What does this all mean? We as Americans have a lot of work to do. We as black men must teach our children that the justice system is still flawed for justice, and to stay as far away from trouble as they possibly can. We as black leaders must press on for justice!  For me personally the meeting with President Obama was an honor and a opportunity to discuss issues that are important in Rural America. I mentioned during the meeting that disadvantaged farmers have gained significant ground during the Obama presidency. We hailed the redress for past discrimination, including black farmers' settlement for $1.25 billion, the Cobell Settlement for $3.4 billion, the Keepseagle Settlement for $760 million and the Women and Hispanic farmers settlement for $1.3 billion. Many of these cases had been pending for decades. The resources in some of the settlements were paid out in the poorest counties in the country.  By settling these cases it shows that President Obama's heart is in the right place. Sure we have more pressing issues to resolve in our federal government. There are too many disparities to mention.  Voting rights, denied to millions of black Americans for a century after passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution are under siege in many states. That fundamental right of democracy is threatened even as the popular movie "Selma" celebrates the risky Alabama crusade that won passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  Every American should see "Selma" I took my family to see the film, which highlights a major struggle of black Americans for freedom and full participation as citizens.  As I prepare to travel to Alabama this week with members of the National Black Farmers Association, I look forward to participating at the 50th anniversary observance of Bloody Sunday in Selma. We anticipate with pride the celebration of a great African American victory over bigotry and discrimination.  President Obama's expected remarks in Selma on March 7th will add to his record of progress in the continuing struggle toward justice and equitable treatment for black Americans. It is not a perfect record, but it far outshines the actions of many previous administrations. And it sets the bar higher for future occupants of the Oval Office. And it lifts the expectations of those in our communities--both for what government should do and for what we should strive toward to be our own solution. 
id=89765, title=The Many Causes of America’s Decline in Crime, url=http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/the-many-causes-of-americas-decline-in-crime/385364/, datepublished=2015-02-11 23:00:00, date=2015-02-24 04:49:54.680000, datesaved=2015-02-24 04:49:54.680000, text=But over the past 25 years, the tide of crime and violence seemed to simply recede. Crime is about half of what it was at its peak in 1991. Violent crime plummeted 51 percent. Property crime fell 43 percent. Homicides are down 54 percent. In 1985, there were 1,384 murders in New York City. Last year there were 333. The country is an undeniably safer place. Growing urban populations are one positive consequence.  The drop in crime stands as one of the more fascinating and remarkable social phenomena of our time. For decades, crime soared. Cities were viewed as unlivable. Politicians competed to run the most lurid campaign ads and sponsor the most punitive laws. Racially tinged “wedge issues” marked American politics from Richard Nixon’s “law and order” campaign of 1968 to the “Willie Horton” ads credited with helping George H.W. Bush win the 1988 election.  Our team of economic and criminal justice researchers spent the last 20 months testing fourteen popular theories for the crime decline. We delved deep into over 30 years of data collected from all 50 states and the 50 largest cities. The results are sharply etched: e do not know with precision what caused the crime decline, but the growth in incarceration played only a minor role, and now has a negligible impact.  So incarceration skyrocketed and crime was in free fall. But conflating simple correlation with causation in this case is a costly mistake. A report from the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, called What Caused the Crime Decline? finds that increasing incarceration is not the answer. As Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz writes in the foreword, “This prodigious rate of incarceration is not only inhumane, it is economic folly.”  Not so fast. There is wide agreement that we do not yet fully know what caused crime to drop. Theories abound, from an aging population to growing police forces to reducing lead in the air. A jumble of data and theories makes it hard to sort out this big, if happy, mystery. And it has been especially difficult to pin down the role of growing incarceration.  The link between rising incarceration and falling crime seems logical. Draconian penalties and a startling expansion in prison capacity were advertised as measures that would bring down crime. That’s what happened, right?  This has profound implications for criminal justice policy: We lock up millions of people in an effort to fight crime. But this is not working.  The dramatic rise of incarceration and the precipitous fall in crime have shaped the landscape of American criminal justice over the last two decades. Both have been unprecedented. Many believe that the explosion in incarceration created the crime drop. In fact, the enormous growth in imprisonment only had a limited impact. And, for the past thirteen years, it has passed the point of diminishing returns, making no effective difference. We now know that we can reduce our prison populations and simultaneously reduce crime.  During that same period, we saw the birth of mass incarceration in the United States. Since 1990, incarceration nearly doubled, adding 1.1 million people behind bars. Today, our nation has 5 percent of the world’s population and 25 percent of the world’s prison population. The United States is the world’s most prodigious incarcerator.  What do the numbers say? Did this explosion in incarceration cause the crime decline?  It turns out that increased incarceration had a much more limited effect on crime than popularly thought. We find that this growth in incarceration was responsible for approximately 5 percent of the drop in crime in the 1990s. (This could vary from 0 to 10 percent.) Since then, however, increases in incarceration have had essentially zero effect on crime. The positive returns are gone. That means the colossal number of Americans cycling in and out of prisons and jails over the last 13 years was not responsible for any meaningful fraction of the drop in crime.  The figure below shows our main result: increased incarceration’s effectiveness since 1980. This is measured as the change in the crime rate expected to result from a 1 percent increase in imprisonment—what economists call an “elasticity.” During the 1980s and 1990s, as incarceration climbed, its effectiveness waned. Its effectiveness currently dwells in the basement. Today, a 1 percent increase in incarceration would lead to a microscopic 0.02 percent decline in crime. This is statistically indistinguishable from having no effect at all.  Increased incarceration accounted for about 6 percent of the property crime decline in the 1990s, and 1 percent of that drop in the 2000s. The growth of incarceration had no observable effect on violent crime in the 1990s or 2000s. This last finding may initially seem surprising. But given that we are sending more and more low-level and non-violent offenders to prison (who may never have been prone to violent crime), the finding makes sense. Sending a non-violent offender to prison will not necessarily have an effect on violent crime.  There is no question that some level of incarceration had some positive impact on bringing down crime. There are many habitual offenders and people committing serious, violent crimes who may need to be kept out of society. Criminologists call this the “incapacitation” effect: Removing someone from society prevents them from committing crimes.  But after a certain point, that positive impact ceases. The new people filling prisons do so without bringing down crime much. In other words, rising incarceration rates produce less of an effect on crime reduction. This is what economists call “diminishing returns.” It turns out that the criminal justice system offers a near perfect picture of this phenomenon.  As incarceration doubled from 1990 to today, it became less effective. At its relatively low levels twenty years ago, incarceration may indeed have had some effect on crime. The positive returns may not have yet diminished.  Incarceration rates have now risen so high that further increases in incarceration are ineffective. Due to the war on drugs and the influx of harsher sentencing laws in the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing proportion of the 1.1 million prisoners added since 1990 were imprisoned for low-level or non-violent crimes. Today, almost half of state prisoners are convicted of non-violent crimes. More than half of federal prisoners are serving time for drug offenses. The system is no longer prioritizing arresting, prosecuting, and incarcerating the most dangerous or habitual offenders. In this case, each additional prisoner will, on average, yield less in terms of crime reduction. We have incarcerated those we should not have. This is where the “more incarceration equals less crime” theory busts.  Even those who have argued for the effectiveness of incarceration acknowledge this possibility. University of Chicago economist and Freakonomics co-author Steven Levitt found in his 2004 study that incarceration was responsible for over a third of the 1990s drop in violent crime. He noted that, “Given the wide divergence in the frequency and severity of offending across criminals, sharply declining marginal benefits of incarceration are a possibility,” which, if present, could have affected his findings.  Can the United States safely reduce its incarcerated population? After all, it would be too bad if reducing incarceration yielded a spike in crime.  Fortunately, there is a real-time experiment underway. For many reasons, including straitened budgets and a desire to diminish prison populations, many states have started to cut back on imprisonment. What happened? Interestingly, and encouragingly, crime did not explode. In fact, it dropped. In the last decade, 14 states saw declines in both incarceration and crime. New York reduced imprisonment by 26 percent, while seeing a 28 percent reduction in crime. Imprisonment and crime both decreased by more than 15 percent in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. Eight states—Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah—lowered their imprisonment rates by 2 to 15 percent while seeing more than a 15 percent decrease in crime.  This is all very significant. Incarceration is not just any government policy. Mass incarceration comes at an incredible cost. “A year in prison can cost more than a year at Harvard,” Stiglitz points out. Taxpayers spend $260 billion a year on criminal justice. And there will continue to be less and less to show for it, as more people are incarcerated.  There are significant human costs as well—to individuals, families, communities, and the country. Spending a dollar on prisons is not the same as spending it on public television or the military. Prisons result in an enormous waste of human capital. Instead of so many low-level offenders languishing behind bars, they could be earning wages and contributing to the economy. Incarceration is so concentrated in certain communities that it has disrupted the gender balance and marriage rates. The costs are intergenerational. There are 2.7 million minor children with a parent behind bars. More than 1 in 9 black children have a parent incarcerated.  Research also shows that incarceration can actually increase future crime. Criminologists call this the “criminogenic eﬀect” of prison. It is particularly powerful on low-level oﬀenders. Once individuals enter prison, they are surrounded by other prisoners who have often committed more serious and violent oﬀenses. Prison conditions also breed violent and anti-social behavior. Former prisoners often have trouble finding employment and reintegrating into society due to legal barriers, social stigma, and psychological scarring from prison. Approximately 600,000 prisoners reenter society each year. Those who can find employment earn 40 percent less than their peers, and 60 percent face long-term unemployment. Researchers estimate that the country’s poverty rate would have been more than 20 percent lower between 1980 and 2004 without mass incarceration.  This lack of stability increases the odds that former prisoners will commit new crimes. The more people we put into prison who do not need to be there, the more this criminogenic effect increases. That is another plausible explanation for why our massive levels of incarceration are resulting in less crime control.  Our findings do not exist in a vacuum. A body of empirical research is slowly coalescing around the ineffectiveness of increased incarceration. Last year, the Hamilton Project issued a report calling incarceration a “classic case of diminishing returns,” based on findings from California and Italy. The National Research Council issued a hefty report last year, finding that crime was not the cause of mass incarceration. And, based on a summary of past research, the authors concluded that that “the magnitude of the crime reduction [due to increased incarceration] remains highly uncertain and the evidence suggests it was unlikely to have been large.”  We go a few steps further to fully reveal the complex relationship between crime and incarceration. By using thirteen years of more recent data, gathered in the modern era of heavily elevated incarceration, combined with an empirical model that accounts for diminishing returns and controls for other variables, we are able to quantify the sharply declining benefits of overusing prison.  But if it was not incarceration, then what did cause the crime decline?  There is no shortage of candidates. Every year, it seems, a new study advances a novel explanation. Levitt attributes about half the crime drop to the legalization of abortion. Amherst economist Jessica Reyes attributes about half the violent crime drop to the unleading of gasoline after the Clean Air Act. Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring credits the police as the central cause. All three theories likely played some role.  Instead of a single, dominant cause, our research points to a vast web of factors, often complex, often interacting, and some unexpected. Of the theories we examined, we found the following factors had some effect on bringing down crime: a growth in income (5 to 10 percent), changes in alcohol consumption (5 to 10 percent), the aging population (0 to 5 percent), and decreased unemployment (0 to 3 percent). Policing also played a role, with increased numbers of police in the 1990s reducing crime (0 to 10 percent) and the introduction of CompStat having an even larger effect (5 to 15 percent).  But none is solely, or even largely, responsible for the crime drop. Unfortunately, we could not fully test a few theories, as the data did not exist at the detailed level we needed for our analysis. For those, we analyzed past research, finding that inflation and consumer confidence (individuals’ belief about the strength of the economy) probably had some effect on crime. The legalization of abortion and unleading of gasoline may also have played some role.  In aggregate, the fourteen factors we identified can explain some of the drop in crime in the 1990s. But even adding all of them together fails to explain the majority of the decrease.  No one factor brought down crime. Today, incarceration has become the default option in the fight against crime. But more incarceration is not a silver bullet. It has, in fact, ceased to be effective in reducing crime—and the country is slowly awakening to that reality. Incarceration can be reduced while crime continues to decline. The research shows this and many states are watching it unfold.  Where do we go from here? As President Obama said it in his State of the Union last month, “Surely we can agree that it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, crime and incarceration have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us.” And indeed, reforming our criminal justice system is emerging as a bipartisan cause. Everyone from Jeb Bush to Hillary Clinton to the Koch Brothers to George Soros has made similar calls.  We should listen to them. There are bold, practical policy solutions starting to gain bipartisan support. Incarceration can be removed as a punishment for many non-violent, non-serious crimes. Violations of technical conditions of parole and probation should not lead to a return trip to prison. Sentence maximum and minimum lengths can be downscaled across the board. There is little reason to jail low-risk defendants who are simply waiting for their trials to begin. And, government funding streams can change to reward reducing incarceration.  Crime is expensive. We do well to fight it. But increasing incarceration is definitely not the answer.

Temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) expires Friday. If Congress and President Obama can’t agree on an appropriations bill by then, it will drape the agency in confusion.  But it won’t shut down, as DHS says, because about 85 percent of its employees would stay on the job.  What would shut down is the pay for all DHS staffers — more than 200,000 of them.  Those who remain on the job would get paid eventually, but who knows when? The 15 percent facing furlough might get paid, but they can’t take “might” to the bank.  This uncertainty hurts morale and can put federal families in financial jeopardy.  This is no way to run a government, particularly an agency that is on the front line against terrorism and drug dealing.  But the Republican insistence that DHS funding legislation include rejection of Obama’s executive actions on immigration have led to a congressional impasse. If the deadlock continues, members of Congress will still get full pay while not fully doing their jobs, yet DHS workers won’t get paid even as they continue to work.  “It’s hard to fathom that in the United States, an employer would stop paying someone and require them to continue working because the board of directors had an issue with the company president,” said Youssef Fawaz, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) import specialist and a vice president of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter in Detroit. “This would be illegal if it happened in the private sector. It’s a sort of indentured servitude.”  Fawaz and his colleagues want no rerun of the 16-day partial government shutdown in October 2013.  “That situation was very stressful for my family due to the fact that both my husband and I are federal employees,” said Kimberly Kraynak-Lambert, a Transportation Security Administration staffer and president of an American Federation of Government Employees local in Pittsburgh. “So for our Congress to play with our livelihood is completely disrespectful and unacceptable.”  The anxiety is no good for employees.  Even “the prospect of a shutdown has a significant effect on the morale of our workforce,” Deputy DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview. The fear of not being compensated or having pay delayed “devalues in their mind the importance of the work they do for our nation,” he added.  Yet Mayorkas says falling employee morale, in a department that already scores poorly, does not lead to declining service or productivity.  “Our people in the Department of Homeland Security are extraordinarily dedicated to their mission and they will accomplish their mission regardless of the budget decisions that are made,” he said. “They will . . . suffer financially, but their dedication is unwavering.”  The Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund has had “dozens of calls from worried employees,” said executive director Steve Bauer.  There’s no news from Capitol Hill to comfort them.  On Monday, the Senate plans to again take up House-approved legislation that would fund the department, but with provisions that would reverse Obama’s immigration actions. Democrats again will block that move and call on the Senate to vote on a clean bill without the poison-pill amendments.  It seems that a simple solution would be to vote on the DHS budget and the immigration issues separately. But that’s too easy. Why do what makes sense when Congress can make it difficult?  Meanwhile, DHS programs stand to suffer even if the majority of its people continue to work.  “The bulk of DHS management and headquarters administrative support activities would cease, including much of the homeland security infrastructure that was built following the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve command, control and coordination of front-line activities,” said Marsha Catron, a DHS spokesperson.  Among the programs that would stop are law enforcement training, grants for state and local disaster and anti-terrorism projects, and electronic employment-eligibility verification.  Almost all Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers would be sent home if the 2013 practice holds. “The current situation is a show-stopper for our grant program,” FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate said. New hires across the department would have to wait “as we work to secure the border, screen millions of passengers every day and prepare for an upcoming presidential election,” Catron said. CBP has placed several technology upgrades on hold.  “Time is running out,” CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske said in a statement. “Congress should pass a clean, full-year appropriations bill. The stakes are simply too high when it comes to ensuring secure and efficient border operations.”  The stakes are too high for all of DHS and its staffers for Republicans to treat them like poker chips.  “Federal employees have taken the blunt of this power struggle between Congress and President Obama,” said Kraynak-Lambert. “Instead of federal employees feeling like their work is vital and valued, we continue to feel like a pawn in this political game.”  Previous columns by Joe Davidson are available at wapo.st/JoeDavidson .

Fortunately, some schools are focusing their efforts on making attending college less of a financial burden and more accessible.  Vassar College is the first winner of the $1 million Jack Kent Cooke Foundation's Cooke Prize for Equity in Educational Excellence for its work in enrolling high-ability, low-income students, the foundation announced Tuesday.  "We wanted to incentivize good behavior, and we wanted to ensure that high-performing, low-income kids who need help in colleges get it," Harold Levy, the foundation's executive director, told The Huffington Post. "Vassar has done something that is quite extraordinary."  In an analysis published in September, The New York Times ranked Vassar as the most accessible top college in the nation -- a distinction it gave the school based on how many students from low-income households were accepted to the most recent freshman class, as well as the net cost of attending. This analysis differed from typical rankings, like that from U.S. News and World Report, which do not take college accessibility into account -- and it influenced the foundation's decision, officials with the nonprofit organization said.  "It’s great to see colleges be rewarded for doing the right thing, because too often they’re rewarded for doing the wrong thing," Steve Burd, senior policy analyst for nonprofit public policy institute Education Policy Program of New America, told HuffPost. "Rankings generally celebrate schools for getting more and more exclusive."  The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation doesn't have any numerical benchmarks to determine whether a school deserves this prize. Instead, it looks at schools comprehensively: The organization aims to honor schools that not only offer financial aid but also work to recruit low-income students and help them succeed while on campus.  "Part of the reason for doing this is to encourage creativity," Levy said. "There’s no single measure of criteria."  Catharine Hill, who became president of Vassar in 2006, has a background in economics focused on college accessibility. One of the biggest changes she made was to dedicate more funding to need-based financial aid. In 2007, she also moved the school back to a need-blind admissions process, meaning that a students' financial background is not a factor in whether they are admitted. The school worked with Questbridge, a nonprofit organization that connects motivated low-income students to selective colleges.  The percentage of first-year students receiving federal Pell Grants, which are awarded to students from lower-income backgrounds, went up from 12 percent in 2007 to 23 percent this year. Now, the average lower-income student at Vassar pays about $6,000 a year, according to the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation -- a number that's significantly lower than the full sticker price of $49,570 for annual tuition.  The $1 million prize is "no-strings-attached," but Levy said he expects that schools will use it to further their efforts in increasing socioeconomic diversity among the student body and supporting students once they are at the school.  "The schools that have made this commitment have already demonstrated that they know how to manage themselves and they know how to do the right thing, and we trust them," Levy said.  Vassar plans on using the money for three causes, Hill said: expanding an orientation program for first-generation and low-income students, increasing support for Dreamers and funding unpaid summer internship opportunities for students.  "Vassar’s been a school that’s committed to making a great education available to students for whom it wasn’t previously available -- that’s why it was founded originally, for young women," Hill said, adding that she wants the college to "live up to the school’s commitment to diversity and issues of social justice."  "A lot of private colleges have really small endowments, so it's difficult for them to provide the kind of support that Vassar’s able to do," Burd said. However, he noted, there are schools that can use funds more responsibly.  "[There's] a lot of outside pressure on the more elite schools to become more diverse," Burd said, "but it’s also a question of how they’re using their institutional aid dollars, and there’s a lot of incentive to use it for merit-based scholarships rather than need-based."  While public colleges may provide more opportunities for poor students because they are larger schools, Burd said, "it’s important that low-income students have the ability to go to the best colleges in the country."  Private and public schools have been taking steps to recruit and support lower-income students. Tufts University made a commitment to "proactively and openly" recruit Dreamers, the school announced on Tuesday, according to The Boston Globe. The City University of New York is returning tuition money to immigrant students who live illegally in the U.S. and paid out-of-state tuition even though they were eligible for in-state rates.  Amherst College, which was one of the first schools to partner with Questbridge, has also been at the front of the movement. The school offers generous scholarships and pays for first-generation and low-income applicants to visit the campus. Amherst announced initiatives to help low-income students, both within Amherst and in the neighboring community, last January at the White House.

Mitch McConnell threw down the gauntlet. "What the administration has done to the coal industry is a true outrage," he said, referring to the loss of mining jobs in his home state of Kentucky. President Obama, he continued, is conducting "a war on coal and, honestly, I'm going to war with him over coal."  Of course, McConnell is not alone. Politicians from major coal-producing states -- particularly Kentucky, West Virginia and Wyoming -- routinely fulminate against what they've dubbed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) "war on coal," and they have vowed to block the agency's new carbon emission rules for coal-fired power plants. But with the Republican takeover of the Senate, McConnell -- in his new role as majority leader -- now has a lot more leverage. For him, coal's threat to the climate, public health and the environment is inconsequential; and to hear him talk, one would think that curbing carbon emissions will throw millions of people out of work.  He's wrong on both counts.     First of all, coal-fired power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions -- accounting for roughly 33 percent -- and the leading industrial source of such "traditional" toxic pollutants as mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide. These emissions have been linked to a range of cancers and cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases. Coal plant particulate pollution, meanwhile, alone kills an estimated 13,000 Americans every year. All told, according to a 2011 Harvard Medical School study, coal's "lifecycle" damage -- from mining to processing to burning -- costs Americans between $345 billion and $523 billion a year.  Second, despite McConnell's grumbling about coal job losses, there are actually more people working in the industry than there were 10 years ago. That said, the number of direct jobs in coal is minuscule, and has been for some time. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the industry employed only 79,400 people in 2013, which amounts to a measly 0.06 percent of the total U.S. private, nonfarm working population. You could fit them all in FedEx Field, home of Washington, D.C.'s NFL team.  Even the number of coal industry jobs in the three biggest coal-producing states is relatively small, according to 2013 BLS data. In sparsely populated Wyoming, which produces 39 percent of America's coal, the industry employed only 6,700 workers -- a mere 2.3 percent of the state residents working in private, nonfarm jobs. Mines in West Virginia, which account for 11 percent of the industry's tonnage, employed 19,980 people -- 2.6 percent of the state's workers. And in Kentucky, where miners extract 8 percent of the country's coal, the industry supported only 11,800 people -- 0.64 percent of the state's total workforce.  So when there are viable, cleaner alternatives, why is Mitch McConnell "going to war" to protect an industry that employs an infinitesimal number of workers and whose product costs us hundreds of billions of dollars a year in health and environmental damages?  Perhaps it's no coincidence that McConnell received more coal industry campaign money in the 2013-2014 election cycle than any other senator -- considerably more. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the $269,050 the industry bestowed on him was roughly three-and-a-half times more than what it gave its second-highest recipient, Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi (R), who received $72,450. McConnell's top campaign contributors between 2009 and 2014 included coal giants Alliance Resource Partners, Koch Industries, Peabody Energy and Southern Company, which collectively donated more than $300,000, as well as Chevron, ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil and Marathon Petroleum, which gave him more than $200,000.  McConnell's support for the coal industry, as well as his take on climate and energy issues writ large, dovetail neatly with his fossil fuel benefactors' point of view. During his reelection campaign last fall, for example, he deflected a Cincinnati Enquirer editorial board question about climate change with the denier camp's retort du jour. "I'm not a scientist," McConnell responded. "I am interested in protecting Kentucky's economy. I'm interested in low-cost electricity."  Given the paltry number of coal jobs and coal's rising cost relative to cleaner sources of electricity -- not to mention the damage it does -- McConnell's claims ring hollow.  Cheaper, Cleaner Alternatives     McConnell and other coal-state politicians like to blame the EPA for the coal industry's woes. No doubt, stronger pollution controls impose additional costs. But the coal industry's biggest problems these days are slow growth in electricity demand; shrinking reserves, which make coal more difficult and expensive to mine; and the fact that utilities are closing down outmoded coal plants and switching to cheaper alternatives, namely natural gas and renewables.      Those market forces have deposed King Coal. As recently as 2006, coal generated nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity. In 2013, its share was down to 39 percent.  Not surprising, the shift from coal to cleaner alternatives has produced more jobs in those sectors. Plenty has been written about the natural gas boom, but renewable technologies, especially solar, have been expanding as well. Last year, the solar industry experienced a 22 percent growth rate, adding more than 31,000 jobs, according to a new Solar Foundation survey. The survey identified 157,500 full-timers and another 16,300 who devoted at least 50 percent of their time to solar projects. The American Wind Energy Association, meanwhile, estimates its industry supports 73,000 workers. Add them together, and their combined workforce is more than three times the size of the coal industry's.  McConnell insists that the EPA's plan to curb power plant carbon emissions is a "job killer." In fact, it is projected to generate tens of thousands new jobs, but it's the renewable sector that will benefit, not coal. A 2013 study by Synapse Energy Economics projected that the gains in new jobs from carbon controls would far outweigh the inevitable job losses in coal country. Synapse estimated an initial net gain of 76,000 jobs nationally in 2016 and 210,000 in 2020 if emissions dropped 26 percent from their peak levels in 2005. The actual EPA proposal goes deeper, cutting power plant emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.  The biggest job killer in coal country over the last half century can be summed up in one word: automation. Most of the job losses can be attributed to technological developments that have dramatically increased worker productivity.  The numbers tell the story. In 1983, 175,640 workers produced 782 million tons of coal from 3,337 mines, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). In 2013, 79,400 workers produced 985 million tons from 1,061 mines, the EIA reported just last week. In other words, fewer than half the workers at a third of the mines were able to produce more coal in 2013 than three decades ago.  That 2013 output, however, is the first time production has fallen below 1 billion tons since 1993. The EIA attributed the 3 percent drop from 2012 to declining production levels out West and in Appalachia, where the largest decrease was in Kentucky.  Looking ahead, the EIA predicts coal production will remain flat over the next decade, but its analysts have yet to factor in the impact of the EPA's new power plant carbon emission rules. As Synapse showed in its analysis, they will mean even more layoffs in communities that can't afford them.  So the question Mitch McConnell should be asking is not how to protect coal jobs, but how to help dislocated miners and coal-dependent communities evolve beyond coal.  Fortunately there are signs that elected officials, community groups, businesses and labor unions are beginning to come together to explore ways to support miners and diversify coal country economies. In Congress, Reps. David McKinley (R-W.Va.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) introduced legislation last fall that would provide laid-off coal miners with retraining, job counseling, and relocation assistance. In Kentucky, Gov. Steve Beshear (D) and U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers (R) launched Shaping Our Appalachian Region (SOAR) in 2013 to develop strategies for expanding economic opportunities in the eastern part of the state. And in West Virginia, a broad coalition of stakeholders last year started What's Next, West Virginia?, a statewide initiative to encourage innovative educational and business opportunities.  What's Next, West Virginia? was sparked in part by a conference two coalition members -- the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy and the West Virginia Community Development Hub -- co-sponsored with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in the fall of 2013. It attracted more than 200 participants, including state and local officials, business owners, energy industry executives, labor representatives, academics, environmentalists and religious leaders.  Jeremy Richardson, a UCS senior energy analyst, organized the conference and wrote a follow-up report titled "A Bright Economic Future for the Mountain State." He firmly believes that's the case.  "The writing is on the mine shaft wall. It's time to look toward the future," said Richardson, who grew up in a West Virginia coal family. "We owe coal miners a great debt for keeping the lights on for generations, and we have an obligation to ensure they have a place in the clean energy economy. The first step is demonstrating that new opportunities exist."  Initiatives in Kentucky, West Virginia and other coal states will take time and money, and it will not be easy to revitalize coal communities that have been on the downhill slide for decades. But that's the task at hand. Sen. McConnell's rear-guard crusade to prop up an uneconomic, polluting industry is misguided at best and -- given the looming threat of climate change -- downright dangerous at worst. It may be in the short-term interest of the coal companies that funded his reelection campaign, but it's not in the long-term interest of coal miners, their communities, or the rest of us.

The parsimonious explanation of Jeb Bush’s self-identification as “Hispanic” on a 2009 voter form is the explanation he offered himself: a simple slip of the pen, a clerical error whose only effect was to skew a government statistic by many zeros past the decimal point. Another ridiculous non-story, right?  Well, maybe not quite. Reporters who spend a lot of time with candidates often accumulate impressions of those candidates that they cannot convey within the norms and conventions of political reporting. You can’t just assert that a candidate is unintelligent, or a habitual liar, or casual with taxpayer money, or a phony consciously building a false image of themselves for political advantage. And oftentimes the proofs of those impressions are tedious, or complicated, or furiously denied by the campaigns’ publicists. And then a story will materialize that’s unimportant in itself—and maybe even exaggerated or unfair—yet which somehow enables the public to see what the reporter sees: Sarah Palin mangling the details of Paul Revere’s ride, Hillary Clinton’s little fib that she carried only one email device, Chris Christie overstepping guidelines on hotel costs, John Edwards’ $400 haircut.  Do you remember the details of the Paul Revere story? So big deal, Clinton had an iPad as well as a Blackberry. Guidelines are just that. Edwards’ haircut actually cost only $150; the other $250 covered the stylist’s travel costs to Edwards’ destination. Silly stuff in every case! And yet notwithstanding its silliness, somehow also true and interesting.  A stray check mark on a form doesn’t mean much—unless it reminds us that what was done inadvertently on one piece of paper echoes a recurring theme of a candidate’s life. In Jeb Bush’s own telling, the central drama of his life has been his self-alienation from his inherited ethnocultural identity and his assimilation through marriage to a new, chosen identity. This is something more than the typical politician’s Steuben Day glad-handing: eating kielbasa with the Polish voters and cannoli in Little Italy, wearing a kippah on Israel Independence Day and a green necktie on St. Patrick's. Just as George H.W. Bush turned his back on the Northeastern Republicanism of Prescott Bush by traveling to Texas and throwing his lot in with Goldwater conservatism; just as New Haven-born George W. Bush defined himself as the Texas-most of the Texans; so Jeb says he is not a WASP, but a bicultural man, raising a bicultural family. He emancipated himself from one identity by adopting another. As Karen Tumulty and Mary Jordan reported in the Washington Post in March, Jeb Bush did not introduce his future wife to either of his parents until the day of the wedding. In that marriage, Jeb Bush found a new self-definition that would shape his life in business and politics over the next 40 years—and that is now the basis for his ideas about how to reshape the nation. The kind of change that he experienced as emancipation, he now urges on the country, in order to keep the United States “young” and “dynamic”—favorite words. Jeb Bush will happily talk about almost any area of policy, but the topic that most engages him is the topic on which he wrote his pre-presidential-run book: immigration. To him, it is the solution to almost all American problems, as it was the solution to so many of his own.  That’s why the dumb story of the errant checkmark caught so much attention. It means nothing! But it reminds us of things that may mean a lot.

The collapse of the government already spelled bad news for the U.S., which benefitted from the fact that Hadi allowed the American military to conduct drone strikes there against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). With Hadi gone, the last vestiges of his power also vanish and leave an uncertain future for U.S. security.  "We have a critical counterterrorism need in Yemen," said CBS News Senior National Security Analyst Juan Zarate. "Al Qaeda branch in the Arabian peninsula, the al Qaeda brand in Yemen, is still deemed by American counterterrorism officials as being the most lethal, most active in terms of going after the West."  In addition to the top al Qaeda bomb maker, the group has dedicated senior-level al Qaeda operatives running their western operations and control more and more territory because of the chaos there.  "That's a problem because you have a safe haven with a group committed to hitting the United States that now may fall under less pressure rather than more and without a U.S. presence on the ground working with Yemeni counterparts you have less pressure," Zarate said.  The other two problems are the spread of instability across the Gulf, which makes U.S. allies in the region nervous, and the fact that there is a proxy battle between Sunni Arab allies and the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.  The Houthis and AQAP are ideologically aligned, Zarate said, by strategically they are in still in competition for who will lead the global jihadi movement. In Yemen, they fight for territory, movement, operatives and resources, which could benefit the U.S., but there is a clear risk of them forming an alliance.  "We've to make sure that we at least keep an eye on and a picture on what's happening in Yemen in particular with Western plotting. That takes deep intelligence work, that takes reliance on our allies in the region to get into these areas that al Qaeda is using to plot and to plan attacks and so keeping our eye on the ball is really important especially as al Qaeda and other actors shift," Zarate said. 
id=69271, title=In the Loop: 5 of 10 lawmakers who talked most about budgets no longer in Congress, url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/02/5-of-10-lawmakers-who-talked-most-about-budgets-no-longer-in-congress/, datepublished=2015-02-02 18:20:06, date=2015-02-02 19:00:22.677000, datesaved=2015-02-02 19:00:22.677000, text=President Obama’s budget, unveiled Monday — asking Congress to break self-imposed spending caps, among other contentious details — may allow relatively new lawmakers their first crack at working seriously on a budget.  What is designed to be a blueprint, a jumping-off point of sorts, for Congress to pass its own budgetary outline has been a casualty of the fractious Congress the last several years. Obama hasn’t submitted proposals on time, and Congress has not passed its own since 2009. Most years it kept the government running with continuing resolutions, which just maintained funding for agencies and programs as they were the year before.  In the midst of debt ceiling and “fiscal cliff” crises, the old-fashioned budget — or “regular order” — didn’t seem like much of a priority.  To underscore that, of the 10 lawmakers who used the word “budget” most often in floor speeches since 2000, half are no longer in office, according to a Sunlight Foundation database:  Many of those names above were giants of the budget process. Senators like Kent Conrad and Judd Gregg were in the game a long time, and there’s been massive turnover in the Senate. But it’s notable that many of the budget stalwarts are gone.  It’s also, in today’s hyper-politicized world, just not a popular or easy topic, said G. William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center.  “I don’t think there is any question that the focus on the budget has come down dramatically in the last few years,” Hoagland said. “I don’t know if it’s because of the people you mentioned — or a combination that those leaders in this area are gone, and because it’s not a popular subject, it’s not a vote-getting topic when you’re back in your district.”  To talk about the budget seriously means talking about difficult third-rail issues, such as entitlement programs and revenue — which both the Obama White House and Congress have lacked the courage to tackle seriously, Hoagland said.  Because so many lawmakers are new — half of the Senate Republican caucus was elected in 2010 or after — many haven’t even been through a budget process that worked as designed, Hoagland said. He cited Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) as up-and-comers in the budget world, and said “getting back to regular order” will help them come into their own.  “There are people I know who are there to blossom into the roles of the Domenicis and the Greggs, but haven’t had that opportunity to do it,” he said.  Obama meeting the budget deadline for the first time in years is a promising start.

He’s quietly embarking on work to persuade the right-flank of the Republican Party he’d be that same kind of conservative in the White House.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush speaks at the winter meeting of the free market Club for Growth winter economic conference at the Breakers Hotel, Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015, in Palm Beach, Fla.  PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jeb Bush readily points to his conservative credentials — tax cuts and smaller government as Florida's governor — yet convincing the activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference that he's one of them might be a tougher sell.  A sign of what Bush faces at CPAC: His speech Friday in Washington follows those by conservative heroes Sen. Marco Rubio, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Sen. Rand Paul and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Tea party activist William Temple is urging people to walk out when Bush takes the podium.  "We're tired of CPAC inviting non-conservatives to come to speak," Temple told The Associated Press.  In what could be a warm-up to his CPAC appearance, Bush recounted eight years of pushing tax cuts, job growth and smaller government as governor when he spoke Thursday to the anti-tax group Club for Growth.  "I ran as a conservative," Bush assured more than 200 people at the group's winter meeting in Palm Beach. "I said what I was going to do and I had a chance to do it. And, trust me, I did."  Bush maintained that his accomplishments in Florida could be duplicated on the national stage.  "If you apply conservative principles and you stick with it, and you have the leadership skills to bring people toward the cause, you can move the needle on these things," he said. "I reject the notion that we can't solve problems, that the gridlock is too enormous to forge consensus. It requires some creativity to get to a win for everybody.  To his would-be rivals for the GOP nomination, Bush suggested that their talk of pursuing conservative goals is cheap.  "It's easy to talk about it," he said. "I hope you believe that you want someone who has the proven leadership skills to make it happen."  Bush is well-prepared for criticism that he's not conservative enough for CPAC activists. Speaking to the Club for Growth, he ticked through eight consecutive years of tax cuts, totaling $19 billion, a state workforce cut by 13,000 and 1.3 million more jobs in 2007 when he left office than when he entered in 1999. He also signed Florida's "stand your ground" gun law and tried to prevent a brain-damaged woman, Terri Schiavo, from having her feeding tube removed.  Today's criticism of Bush centers almost entirely on his support for Common Core and an immigration policy that would create a path to citizenship for people living in the country illegally. He is also hurt by lingering resentment over the rise in government spending during the administration of his brother, President George W. Bush.  Bush rekindled the misgivings of some skeptics late last year when he said a Republican might need to "lose the primary to win the general," viewed by some as a swipe at the heavy influence of conservatives in picking the party's presidential nominee.  Just 4 in 10 self-identified conservatives and tea party supporters rated Bush favorably in an Associated Press-GfK poll conducted earlier this month.  Aware of the intraparty doubts, Bush's team is busy reviving old alliances, in phone calls and private meetings, with top social and economic conservatives, broadening his network of conservative opinion leaders and trying to quiet his more aggressive critics.

A pedestrian walks past the U.S. Capitol last month. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  Conservative state legislators frustrated with the gridlock in Washington are increasingly turning to a plan to call a convention to consider a new amendment to the U.S. Constitution — an event that would be unprecedented in American history and one that could, some opponents predict, lead to complete political chaos.  Legislators in 27 states have passed applications for a convention to pass a balanced budget amendment. Proponents of a balanced budget requirement are planning to push for new applications in nine other states where Republicans control both chambers of the legislature.  If those applications pass in seven of the nine targeted states, it would bring the number of applications up to 34, meeting the two-thirds requirement under Article V of the Constitution to force Congress to call a convention.  What happens next is anyone’s guess.  “There really isn’t much of a precedent. We’ll be charting new waters,” said Utah Senate President Wayne Niederhauser (R), a supporter of a constitutional convention. Utah became the 26th state to issue an application last month. North and South Dakota have also approved applications this year.  The problem is that while the Constitution allows amendments to be adopted and sent to the states by a two-thirds vote of both the House and Senate, or by a national convention called by two-thirds of the states, the founding document is silent on how such a convention would operate. How many delegates each state would receive, the rules under which a convention would operate and who would set the agenda would be left up to Congress – all of those would be open questions.  Most worrying to some who oppose the convention: There’s no indication that a convention could be limited to just one topic. Hypothetically, delegates could take up any issue they wanted, from reinstating Prohibition to eliminating the direct election of senators. More extreme scenarios envision delegates revisiting the 13th Amendment, which banned slavery, or inserting corporate giveaways into the Constitution.  “There’s no authority establishing in the Constitution above that of a convention. If you call a convention, what you’re doing is opening up the Constitution to whatever the delegates want to propose,” said Michael Leachman, director of state fiscal research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the center-left think tank that has opposed calls for a convention since the 1980s.  Leachman said such a convention could lead to a frenzy of lobbying and influence-peddling never before seen in American history. “You’d have every interest group in the country recognizing that, if you’re opening up the Constitution, they want in on that,” he said.  Even supporters acknowledge that a convention would be difficult to control.  “Can [a convention’s agenda] be limited? That’s a good question. We don’t know,” Utah’s Niederhauser said. “I suspect there would be a lot of discussion of that as we get closer to the 34 states calling a convention.”  Legislation to call a convention to consider a balanced budget amendment is pending in four of the nine targeted states — Idaho, Arizona, South Carolina and Oklahoma. Bills to call a convention failed in four others: Virginia, Wyoming, West Virginia and Montana. No bill has yet been introduced in Wisconsin.  Applications for conventions under Article V are as old as the republic itself. Virginia’s legislature issued the first such application on Nov. 14, 1788, less than five months after the Constitution was officially established in June of that year. Over the centuries, every state but one — Hawaii — has issued an application for a convention, on topics as broad as eliminating the electoral college, outlawing polygamy, limiting income taxes and making abortion illegal. None have ever reached the two-thirds necessary to trigger a convention.  The most serious effort began in the 1970s and early 1980s, when 32 states passed calls for a convention to create a balanced budget amendment. But over the years, as it became clear that they couldn’t reach the 34 states necessary, half of those states reversed themselves and rescinded their applications. (A balanced budget amendment failed by just a single vote in the Senate in 1995; Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield, the only Republican to vote against it, offered to resign before the vote, an offer Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole rejected).  A renewed push in recent years, led by Republican legislators concerned with the nation’s mounting debt and the federal government’s increasing reach into domains previously reserved for the states, persuaded another 11 states to join the remaining 16.  But even the number of states with live applications is up for debate. Michael Paulsen, a constitutional law expert at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, contends that applications that purport to limit subjects covered in a constitutional convention are invalid.  Other experts disagree. The Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force, a group with close ties to the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, says the 16 applications from the 1970s and 1980s remain valid, putting the number of states with live applications at 27.  “This is something that our legislative members felt pretty strongly about for quite some time,” said Molly Fuhs, an ALEC spokeswoman.  Proponents of a convention say Congress has used applications by the states as an impetus for action in the past.  “Constitutional amendments have never been originated in the states because whenever there are calls in the states, Congress gets ahead of it,” said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow of constitutional studies at the Cato Institute and a supporter of the Compact for America, which has passed applications in Mississippi, Georgia and Alaska. “Congress will see the writing on the wall.”  But the fact that Republicans have swept to control in so many legislative chambers — enough to spur a convention — has opponents worried.  “This is by far the most dangerous thing in the country today,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the campaign finance advocacy group Democracy 21. “If we ever got [to a convention], this would create a constitutional crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetimes.”

In that case, the court ruled 5 to 4 that lower court judges should look more closely at whether lawmakers made race the predominate factor in drawing new district lines after the 2010 census.  In Virginia, a three-judge federal district court panel in the fall ruled that the Virginia General Assembly must draw new congressional maps because the current plan concentrates African-American voters into a single district at the expense of their influence elsewhere.  The court ruled that race was the predominate factor in drawing the lines. The commonwealth’s congressional delegation consists of seven Republicans and three Democrats.  At issue is the number of African-American voters in the majority-black 3rd Congressional District, which is represented by U.S. Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott.  The Supreme Court vacated the lower court’s decision, and said it could be considered in light of the decision in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama.

Bruce Rauner's Anti-Union Proposal Illegal\, Illinois Attorney General Says, url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/21/rauner-anti-union-proposal_n_6915906.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics, datepublished=2015-03-21 17:56:31, date=2015-03-21 18:26:26.974000, datesaved=2015-03-21 18:26:26.974000, text=llinois Gov. Bruce Rauner speaks to students, teachers and community members on the state of Illinois' economy at Richland Community College Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015, in Decatur Ill. Rauner continued to lay out priorities for his first year in office, telling the audience about a proposal to create so-called âright to work zonesâ was aimed at jump-starting economically depressed areas in the union-friendly state. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman) | ASSOCIATED PRESS  CHICAGO (AP) -- Illinois' Democratic attorney general on Friday delivered a blow to Gov. Bruce Rauner's efforts to weaken labor unions, saying two of the main ideas the Republican has been pitching across the state would be illegal.  Lisa Madigan issued formal opinions at the request of Democratic lawmakers who anticipated legislation would be proposed after Rauner first trumpeted his plans in his State of the State speech last month.  One proposal would allow voters to create "right-to-work zones" in Illinois counties where union membership and dues would be voluntary. The other would let local governments or school districts opt out of prevailing wage agreements, which require workers on public works projects to receive wages that reflect local compensation for similar jobs.  Rauner's office, in a statement, noted voters would decide whether his proposed legislation to protect employee rights should apply within their respective county, municipality, school district or other unit of local government. It said that would comply with the National Labor Relations Act.  Before crowds across Illinois in recent weeks, the multimillionaire businessman has argued unions have too much power and that overly generous salaries, benefits and pensions helped create Illinois' financial crisis. He says local voters should decide whether union influence should be curbed.  Rauner also says school districts could save almost $160 million per year if prevailing wage laws were changed and that establishing zones where employees have a choice on whether to join a union would help attract businesses - and much-needed jobs - to the state.  But Madigan said federal labor law only allows right-to-work to be enacted on a statewide basis, not by individual counties. She said both ideas also would violate state law.  Changing those laws or passing a right-to-work on a statewide basis would be nearly impossible in Illinois, where Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature and several Republican legislators also have been allies of organized labor.  Democratic state Sen. Gary Forby, one of the legislators who requested the legal opinion, said he hoped it would put an end to Rauner's rhetoric so lawmakers can instead focus on a state budget that is billions of dollars in the red.  "This guy, all he talks about is right-to-work states," said Forby, the chairman of the Senate's labor committee. "Well, now he can stop talking about right-to-work states and go back to trying to do a budget for the state of Illinois."  Madigan's opinions are just the latest in what's been a rocky early attempt by Rauner to take on organized labor. After he issued an executive order and sued to try to eliminate fees paid to unions by workers who choose not to join, more than two dozen unions filed their own lawsuit to stop him. Madigan also ruled that action by the governor was illegal, and the Republican comptroller said she wouldn't comply with the governor's plan to hold the dues in a state escrow account.  Rauner, who has called governors in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan who have stripped rights from unions his "role models," also has proposed banning unions from making campaign contributions.  Illinois AFL-CIO President Michael Carrigan said Madigan's opinions confirmed what unions suspected from the start.  "While Gov. Rauner continues his obsessive war on unions and the middle class, he just keeps running into huge road blocks - like the law," Carrigan said.

Scott Walker is the new frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, while former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton easily maintains her lead among Democrats. And despite the personal email scandal, Clinton’s personal favorable number is still higher than the rest of the pack, according to the latest Fox News poll.  Walker tops the field for the Republican nomination with 15 percent among self-identified GOP primary/caucus voters. He’s followed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush who receives 12 percent, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 11 percent and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee each at 10 percent.  CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS  Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul earns nine percent support and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio gets eight percent. All others receive four percent or less.  Support for Walker is up six percentage points over the nine percent he received from self-identified Republicans two months ago (when Mitt Romney’s name is removed from the January poll for an apples-to-apples comparison).  Cruz became the first major 2016 hopeful to announce his candidacy officially (March 23). He also gained six points since January.  The top three picks for those who consider themselves part of the Tea Party movement are Carson (21 percent), Cruz (18 percent) and Walker (16 percent).  Meanwhile, on the favorability ratings included for several of the potential 2016 candidates, it’s striking how negatively most voters perceive the current crop of aspirants.  Carson, Walker and Rubio stand out because, even though they are still mostly unknown, they are the only ones -- Democrat or Republican -- who have net positive ratings.  More voters view Carson favorably than unfavorably by nine percentage points, Walker by six points and Rubio by four. All others are viewed negatively, although for Paul and Huckabee it’s by just one point.  Bush, the best known candidate on the GOP side, is viewed more negatively (49 percent) than positively (33 percent) by 16 points. The best known on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, has a net negative of minus three points.  In spite of the uproar about the personal emails, Clinton’s favorability rating hasn’t moved much. Some 47 percent of voters view her positively today. That’s down from 51 percent last year (June 2014) and a high of 63 percent in August 2012. Slightly more voters, 50 percent, have a negative opinion of her, up from 47 percent last summer.  Moreover, Clinton maintains a large lead among Democratic contenders for their party’s nomination, receiving 61 percent among self-identified Democratic primary/caucus voters. Vice President Joe Biden comes in at 12 percent and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 11 percent.  While Clinton leads among all subgroups of Democratic primary voters, women (71 percent) are significantly more supportive than men (45 percent). Men (18 percent) are more than twice as likely as women (7 percent) to support Warren.  If Clinton were to drop out, Biden is the frontrunner with 42 percent -- well ahead of Warren who gets 22 percent.  For the first time, Bush ties Clinton at 45 percent each in a hypothetical matchup. Clinton has the advantage over the other Republicans tested, topping Walker and Cruz each by 48-42 percent, Rubio by 47-43 percent and Paul by 47-45 percent.  Independents prefer the GOP candidate over Clinton in each case -- by as much as 15 points (Paul) to as little as one point (Cruz).  Over half of women back Clinton in each of the hypothetical matchups. Some people think that’s all about gender. Yet the poll finds that 80 percent of voters, including 81 percent of men, think it would be wrong to assume most women will automatically vote for Clinton because she’s a woman.  Women have backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1992.  Bush performs best against Clinton in the head-to-head matchups. If that continues, it would allow him to argue he is more electable than other GOP contenders. But before that, the party faithful have to put him in that spot (i.e., nominate him), and he currently has the lowest net favorability rating among Republicans (+18 points) of all the GOPers tested. Those with the highest favorable scores among Republicans include Huckabee (+39 points) and Walker (+38 points).  Voters have mixed views over whether Clinton did something wrong by using a personal email account and server instead of the government’s email system. Nearly half think she broke the law (28 percent) or did something unethical (19 percent). The other half feel Clinton just used bad judgment (32 percent) or didn’t do anything wrong (19 percent).  Most Democrats say Clinton used bad judgment (42 percent) or did nothing wrong (32 percent).  Republicans (48 percent) are six times as likely as Democrats (8 percent) to believe Clinton broke the law. Independents (32 percent) are four times more likely than Democrats to say so.  Overall, only 11 percent of voters think Clinton should be the one to decide which emails should be turned over to the government. Most people say an independent mediator should decide (34 percent) or she should be required to turn over all the emails (51 percent).  The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,025 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from March 29-31, 2015. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The results among Democratic and Republican primary voters have an error of plus or minus five points.

That school council meeting was the first to draw any public speakers in five years, and the fight it kicked off didn’t stop that night. Upset parents complained and tried, unsuccessfully, to repeal the measure. Now Republican state lawmakers are picking up the baton, backing a bill that would require students in Kentucky to use the facilities that correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificate.  At a time when the U.S. Supreme Court appears poised to make marriage equality the law of the land, so-called “bathroom bills” that target transgender people have emerged as one of the most contentious remaining battlegrounds over LGBT rights. Kentucky’s bill has passed the Republican-controlled Senate and is set to be considered by the Democrat-controlled House, though the leadership is unlikely to take it up. In Florida, a House committee passed a bill on March 4 that would make it a misdemeanor for anyone to knowingly enter a bathroom that didn’t match the sex on their driver’s license or passport. “There is a culture of fear around bathroom use,” says Teagan Widmer, a transgender woman who runs an app called Refuge Restrooms, which maps gender-neutral restrooms around the world. “It’s fear that drives the legislation.”  Proponents of the measures say they are about safety. State Rep. Frank Artiles, the sponsor of the Florida bill, has argued that the bill is necessary to prohibit voyeurism and rape. In the bill he sponsored, Kentucky State Sen. C.B. Embry wrote: “Parents have a reasonable expectation that schools will not allow minor children to be viewed in various states of undress by members of the opposite biological sex.” If Embry’s bill does manage to pass the House and become law, students would be able to sue their schools for $2,500 if they encountered a person of the opposite biological sex in the bathroom.  Opponents say these concerns unfounded and dismiss the bills as solutions in search of a problem. “It’s always a transgender person who is at far greater risk of being attacked in a bathroom,” Maryland State Sen. Richard Mandaleno told TIME in an interview for a previous story, when organizers in his state were pushing a similar bill in 2014. “There’s always this parade of outlandish consequences that are going to occur that never do.”  These bathroom bills come as advocates for LGBT rights are pushing non-discrimination bills in at least 10 states, including Florida. Many aim to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from being fired, denied housing or turned away from a business because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Florida bill, called the Florida Competitive Workforce Act, is built around the argument that policies need to be as inclusive as possible for the state to attract top workers and businesses. A coalition backed by major corporate entities, including Marriott and Walt Disney World Resort, has formed to support the measure.  Currently 18 states have laws protecting people from discrimination based on either their sexual orientation or gender identity; three more states cover just sexual orientation. Ian Palmquist, a director at the Equality Federation, a national group that helps support state-level policy change, says Pennsylvania and North Dakota may pass non-discrimination bills this session. And he points to a non-discrimination measure recently introduced in Utah as evidence of a turning tide: it’s backed by a faith coalition that includes the Mormon church, a group that was instrumental in passing California’s now-defunct ban on gay marriage in 2008.  “There have been years of work that have led up to this,” Palmquist says of the bill announced March 4. “It’s a historic step to have a relatively conservative denomination like the Mormon church taking a stand and saying LGBT people should be treated fairly and equally.” The bill includes religious exemptions that would not hold churches or other religious organizations to the same bar as private businesses or individuals when it comes to employment and housing.  Supporters are also trying to further transgender rights in other arenas. A California bill would prohibit the state from doing business with companies that deny transgender workers benefits like healthcare coverage. A Rhode Island bill would prohibit conversion therapy that seeks to change the gender identity or sexual orientation of any resident under the age of 18. A measure in Illinois would secure a deceased transgender person’s right to have a funeral that respects their preferred “appearance, chosen name, and gender pronouns.”  And advocates like Widmer are doing what they can for transgender people outside the statehouse. She recalls sex-segregated bathrooms being traumatizing places when she began her transition from appearing male to appearing female. “In a woman’s restroom I might get called a man and yelled at, but while using a men’s restroom I might get called a faggot or a tranny and then beaten up,” she says. “It doesn’t seem like a controversial issue to me, it’s pretty simple. People need to pee.” 
id=94013, title=No Panic Buttons for the Public: Why Open Carry Is Bad for America, url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shannon-watts/no-panic-buttons-for-the-public-why-open-carry-is-bad-for-america_b_6633012.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics, datepublished=2015-02-13 20:29:10, date=2015-02-13 21:07:20.613000, datesaved=2015-02-13 21:07:20.613000, text=It's official: the phrase "open carry" has entered the American lexicon. That's because gun extremists from Virginia to Washington to Texas and all across the country have started showing up in restaurants, state capitols, and other public places openly carrying loaded semiautomatic rifles. Occasionally donning kilts or gas masks and other attention-getting attire, these extremists look as though they are headed to battle instead of visiting their legislators or picking up milk at their local Kroger grocery store.  Why are we seeing these open carry displays more and more often? Because the radical rhetoric of the National Rifle Association's (NRA) leadership tells us that "the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." And that myth propels the idea that a loaded AK-47 is necessary when dining at Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, just in case you encounter a bad guy.  Thanks to the gun lobby's insidious and formerly unchecked influence in our state legislatures, open carry is legal in more than 40 states. And in a majority of those states, it's perfectly legal to open carry a long gun with absolutely no training, permitting, or even a minimum age requirement.  Add to that cocktail of crazy the fact that our lax federal gun laws allow criminals and other dangerous people to easily access firearms. Given that millions of guns each year are sold without a criminal background check, there is no way to know if a person who is openly carrying a semiautomatic rifle is a responsible gun owner, or if that person is a threat to moms and our children (and the gas masks don't help either).  Law enforcement leaders have come out in opposition to open carry because it forces them to ask questions that jeopardize their ability to ensure public safety, like "Does this person have a permit? Is he a felon?" And it's a drain on law enforcement resources as well. As this video posted by open carry extremists highlights, there is nothing normal about seeing men marching around carrying rifles; it causes genuine concern. Subsequently, when people call 9-1-1, a police officer must be dispatched and forced to deal with difficult open carry extremists.  In Texas, an open carry activist with an arrest record for interfering with police duties recently posted a video threatening Texas state legislators with death if they oppose legislation to legalize unlicensed open carry of handguns. These same gun extremists were responsible for forcing the Texas state legislature to install panic buttons in their chambers last month.  This extremism is dangerous and, not surprisingly, encouraged by NRA leaders given their support and continued push for open carry expansion. For decades, the NRA has attempted to normalize behaviors that are unsafe, and expanding open carry is simply an attempt by the gun lobby to make it acceptable for anyone to openly carry guns anywhere.  In Tennessee, the law allows permit holders to carry guns openly or concealed, but last year, the NRA sponsored legislation that would remove the permit requirement to open carry in Tennessee. This would have made it legal for stalkers and certain other criminals to openly carry loaded handguns in Tennessee, and it would be legal for anyone to openly carry a loaded gun without any gun safety training whatsoever.  But just like Rick Perry (someone I never thought I would cite as an example), who said this week that he was not "all that fond of this open carry concept," Moms are not willing to go down the NRA's slippery slope. We know that respecting the Second Amendment requires responsible gun ownership and practicing gun safety.  The safety of our children and families in our communities is paramount, and open carry is not a step in the right direction. We refuse to have to consider whether people who are open carrying around our children and families are members of law enforcement sworn to protect us, or if they are activists making a political statement, or dangerous criminals we should run from.  And while we wait for legislators to do their jobs instead of catering to extremists' tantrums and pass laws that protect people instead of gun lobby profits, we expect businesses to do their part. Simply following state and local laws is not enough. In states where no background check is required to buy a semiautomatic rifle and carry it openly in public, businesses have a duty to protect their employees and customers.  This is why Moms are asking retailers like Kroger and restaurants like Raising Cane's to prioritize customer and employee safety. And it's why we've worked with other restaurants and retailers like Chipotle, Sonic, Starbucks and Target to stand up to this extremist behavior and ask their customers to leave their firearms at home.  Open carry extremists have shined a bright light on the NRA's vision for the future of America, and it's not pretty. Moms won't let the concerted efforts by the gun lobby and open carry extremists to put our families and communities at risk go unchecked. With rights come responsibilities, and for the safety and security of our restaurants, state capitols, and other public places, we must push back on armed intimidation. After all, there are no panic buttons for the public.

The address has caused an uproar that has exposed tensions between Israel and its most important ally, the United States. In accepting a Republican invitation to address Congress, Netanyahu angered the White House, which was not consulted with in advance of the invite, as well as Democrats who were forced to choose between showing support for Israel and backing their president.  Netanyahu plans to express his disapproval over a potential deal between Iran and world powers that he says falls short of preventing Tehran from having the ability to make an atomic bomb. A preliminary deadline is late this month.  "I feel deep and genuine concern for the security of all the people of Israel," Netanyahu told reporters on the tarmac, his wife by his side, before boarding his flight. "I will do everything in my ability to secure our future."  He called the trip a "crucial and even historic mission" and said he feels like "an emissary" of all citizens of Israel and the Jewish people.  Tuesday's speech to Congress has touched off a wave of criticism in Israel, where Netanyahu is seeking re-election on March 17.  His main challenger, Isaac Herzog, had demanded he cancel the speech. The former head of Israel's Mossad spy agency has called the address pointless and counterproductive. Netanyahu has long been a vocal critic of Iran, and his position is already well-known.  Stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb has become a defining challenge for both President Barack Obama and Netanyahu, yet they have approached the issue differently.  Netanyahu considers unacceptable any deal that doesn't end Iran's nuclear program entirely. Obama appears to be willing to leave some nuclear activity intact, backed by safeguards that Iran is not trying to develop a weapon.  Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

He had visited Louisville, Kentucky, earlier in the day.  Obama began the year four states short of having visited all 50. The White House quickly scheduled trips to Idaho and South Carolina before Friday's stop in Utah.  It's unclear how soon Obama will visit South Dakota. But with 21 months left on his term, he has plenty of time to get there.

This is day two of a White House conference on extremism. The president declined to label al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) "Islamic terrorists," and he's taking some heat from critics.  "The notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie," said Obama. "And all of us, regardless of our faith, have a responsibility to reject it."  At a White House conference on violent extremism, Mr. Obama appeared to take pains to separate Islam from terrorism.  Critics fault the president for not labeling the terror Islamic, and at a private Republican gathering in New York Wednesday night, former mayor Rudy Giuliani went even further.  "I do not believe that the president loves America. What's wrong with this man," asked Giuliani, "that he can't stand up and say there's a part of Islam that's sick?"  But the president has called on Muslims to actively reject extremism.  "Muslim communities, including scholars and clerics, therefore have a responsibility to push back, not just on twisted interpretations of Islam, but also on the lie that we are somehow engaged in a clash of civilizations," he said.  And President George W. Bush walked the same line immediately following the 9/11 attacks.  "The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself."  White House aides say the reason Mr. Obama won't refer to violence by Muslims as "Islamic terrorism" is that he wants to deny them the ability to call the clash a religious war.

(Photo by David Vaaknin - Pool/Getty Images) | Pool via Getty Images  JERUSALEM (AP) — A former chief of Israel's Mossad spy agency is slamming the prime minister's handling of the Iranian nuclear threat.  Ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's contentious speech to Congress, Meir Dagan says "the person who has caused the greatest strategic damage to Israel on the Iranian issue is the prime minister."  The comments were published Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.  Dagan has been a fierce critic of Netanyahu's approach to Iran, emerging as a key opponent of a potential Israeli military attack against its nuclear facilities. He says Netanyahu's trip to Washington, over White House objections, is pointless and counterproductive.  Dagan directed the Mossad from 2002 to 2010, a period when it reportedly carried out covert attacks against Iranian nuclear scientists and unleashed cyber-attacks that delayed Iran's progression toward a bomb.

Yemen is slipping further into chaos as the Houthis, an Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim militia from the north, consolidate their grip on power after seizing the capital in September and sidelining the central government.   The fighters have been advancing into southern territories, confronting Sunni Muslim tribesmen, other groups and the local branch of al Qaeda.   "We believe the situation is very dangerous. Yemen is on the brink of civil war," Benomar said in an interview with television channels al Arabiya and al-Hadath late on Wednesday.   Al Qaeda-affiliated fighters seized an army base in southern Yemen and held soldiers prisoner on Thursday. The United States, Britain and France have closed their embassies in Sanaa, citing security concerns.   Benomar said Yemen's economy was facing imminent collapse and called for more dialog to reach a peaceful settlement.   "They are all party to what has happened so far, they have all made mistakes and follies and sometimes groups resorted to violence to realize political aims," the envoy said.   Yemen, which borders top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, is home to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the global network's most active arms that has carried out attacks abroad.

id=196842, title=The Case Against Robert Menendez, url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/robert-menendez-is-indicted-for-corruption/389366/, datepublished=2015-04-02 01:12:36, date=2015-04-08 02:57:24.233000, datesaved=2015-04-08 02:57:24.233000, text=The Democratic senator from New Jersey faces a long list of charges, centered on his mutually beneficial relationship with  "Politics as usual"—it's a phrase that's rooted in a cynical view of how our elected officials operate. The assumption is that even if what they're doing isn't exactly illegal, it's probably untoward.  The central theme of the Department of Justice's 68-page indictment of New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez is the line between what's usual and what's illegal. The indictment concerns the Democrat's relationship with Dr. Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist. The two have been friends for years, and their relationship has been under media scrutiny for some time. The federal investigation has also been underway for some time, and the charges have seemed imminent for weeks. On Wednesday, prosecutors charged Menendez and Melgen with one count of conspiracy, one count of violating the travel act, eight counts of bribery, and three counts of honest services fraud. Menendez was also hit with an extra count of making false statements.  Some of what's in the document seems difficult to explain away. It alleges, for example, that Menendez asked Melgen to pay for a nearly $5,000 stay in a five-star Paris hotel using AmericanExpress points. Here's the relevant passage:  Then again, other passages seem comparatively benign. Justice says that Menendez solicited a donation from Melgen to a colleague in the Senate, to reciprocate $25,000 in contributions to Menendez's own campaign. Of course, politicians fundraise for each other regularly.  But in delivering the lengthy indictment, prosecutors paint a picture of a long-running, intimate, and lucrative quid pro quo. The $8,000 that Melgen and his wife gave to the other senator's campaign comprises just a small fraction of what prosecutors say totaled $751,500 in contributions to Menendez's 2012 reelection campaign alone. Prosecutors allege that Menendez concealed these gifts, although some of that is already known—in 2013, he repaid Melgen for $53,000 in flights that he admitted he should not have accepted.  As for the quo part of the equation, the indictment fills in some of the details on press reports. Menendez and his staff are portrayed as working to assist Melgen on variety of fronts: in winning a contract for port security in the Dominican Republic for a company Melgen controlled; with a federal investigation into Melgen's Medicare billing practices (Melgen bills more to Medicare than any other doctor in the United States); and in acquiring visas for young girlfriends of Melgen's from Brazil and Ukraine (in an email, one staffer boasted to another, "In my view this is ONLY DUE to the fact that RM intervened. I've told RM").  Taken individually, many of the individual incidents in the indictment seem questionable, but more like the sort of favors many elected officials perform for friends than like smoking guns. But in aggregate, prosecutors use them to create a picture of long-running corruption. The intent seems to be to present a reader—or, more importantly, a juror—with such a litany of questionable acts that the appearance of a tradeoff becomes unavoidable.  The stakes are high for Menendez—it's his political life and perhaps his freedom. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and insists he is innocent. So far, his state's other senator, fellow Democrat Cory Booker, is sticking with him. The state's largest newspaper, The Star-Ledger is not—it published an editorial calling on Menendez to "resign and spare us the drama." (That said, the paper also issued a conditional demand for Governor Chris Christie to resign more than a year ago, and he's still kicking.)  But there's lots of risk for the Justice Department, too. Its public-corruption unit was rocked by the disastrous prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens. The Alaska Republican was convicted of corruption and lost his seat, but an inquiry later found that prosecutors engaged in "reckless professional misconduct" and withheld evidence from the defense. Attorney General Eric Holder eventually asked for the conviction to be thrown out. The department hasn't indicted a sitting senator since. That may explain the painstaking list of facts here, and the deliberate pace of the indictment. But will the procession of facts be enough to prove that what Menendez did was more than just politics as usual?

In a Monday speech at Oxford University, the artist and rap mogul said racism may be fading away, but classism is still used to discriminate against people.  “What good is anything that everyone can’t have?” he said at the end of the meandering lecture, according to a transcript posted on student news site The Tab Oxford. “They think we’re done with racism. What about elitism? What about separatism? What about classism?”  Despite his penchant for designer clothing -- his line of Nike Air Yeezy sneakers have sold for thousands of dollars on eBay -- he said the price of clothing items like sweaters, for example, should never exceed $5,000.  “You know what should cost $5,000? A car should be $5,000,” he declared. “And you know who should work on the car? The people who work on the $500,000 cars. All the best talent in the world needs to work for the people.”  West’s net worth is estimated at $130 million, according to the Celebrity Net Worth, a site that analyzes famous entertainers’ finances. But he said he remains sensitive to the average person’s aspirations.  “I’m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded rich people,” he said during his Oxford speech. “But in learning that, being brought up middle-class, it’s something that is beating out of my chest. ‘Wait a second, I was middle-class, and I didn’t get to see none of this shit!’”  Gabe Tesoriero, West's spokesman, did not respond to an email requesting comment.  West's Oxford speech echoed comments about classism he made during an interview last week with BBC Radio 1’s Zane Lowe.  “Class is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in their place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much they have in their account for retirement,” he said at the time.  His concerns are well-founded. Income inequality is increasing around the world. Capital in the Twenty-First Century, a blockbuster book published last year by French economist Thomas Piketty, revealed that the gap between rich and poor would continue to widen if capitalist economic systems were left unfettered.  Kanye might enjoy reading Piketty's book, if he has't already. And he'd probably be one of the few people to make it past page 26.

Jeb Bush will proclaim Wednesday that “I am my own man,” in an effort by the all-but-certain 2016 Republican presidential contender to distance himself from the legacies of his father and brother.  During an address at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs that will mark his first major foreign policy speech as a would-be candidate, the son and brother of presidents will deliver a broadside against President Barack Obama’s leadership on the global stage.  “Under this administration, we are inconsistent and indecisive,” Bush will say, according to prepared remarks released by his political action committee, Right to Rise PAC. “We have lost the trust and the confidence of our friends. We definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies.”  His last name being both one of his strongest assets and greatest liabilities, Bush will allude to a turbulent history, especially in the foreign policy realm, as he seeks to craft his own White House campaign.  “I love my father and my brother,” he will say. “But I am my own man—and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences.”  Bush has spent time over the last year consulting with foreign policy experts as he prepared to mount a White House bid, but is not expected to explicitly break with either family member’s foreign policy. In broad terms, Bush will also levy criticism agaomst Obama for his handling of his “red line” with regards to Syria’s use of chemical weapons, Russia’s escalation’s in eastern Ukraine, Boko Haram’s insurgency in Nigeria, and the personal distrust between the President and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  “They draw red lines… then erase them,” Bush will say. “With grandiosity, they announce resets and disengage. Hashtag campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement. Personal diplomacy and maturity is replaced by leaks and personal disparagement.”  A former governor, Bush’s foreign policy has largely been undefined, though emails from his time in office reveal he supported his brother, President George W. Bush, in the invasion of Iraq.  Asked by reporters on Friday about his foreign policy in the context of his family’s long history, Bush said “I won’t talk about the past.”  “I’ll talk about the future,” Bush said, according to Bloomberg. “If I’m in the process of considering the possibility of running, it’s not about re-litigating anything in the past. It’s about trying to create a set of ideas and principles that will help us move forward.”  Speaking to reporters earlier in the week about how he would address the threat of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), Bush said, “I think we need to develop a world strategy to take ‘em out.”  See the full excerpts below:  My goal today is to explore how America can regain its leadership in the world.   And why that leadership is more necessary than ever.   American leadership projected consistently and grounded in principle has been a benefit to the world.  …   I have doubts whether this administration believes American power is such a force.   Under this administration, we are inconsistent and indecisive.   We have lost the trust and the confidence of our friends.   We definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies.  …   The great irony of the Obama Presidency is this: Someone who came to office promising greater engagement with the world has left America less influential in the world.  …   The United States has an undiminished ability to shape events and build alliances of free people.   We can project power and enforce peaceful stability in far-off areas of the globe.   To do so, I believe we need to root our foreign policy in a set of priorities and principles.  …   I also have been lucky to have a father and a brother who both have shaped America’s foreign policy from the Oval Office.   I recognize that as a result, my views will often be held up in comparison to theirs’ – sometimes in contrast to theirs’.   I love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make.   But I am my own man – and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences.   Each president learns from those who came before – their principles… their adjustments.   One thing we know is this: Every president inherits a changing world… and changing circumstances.  …   The transformation of our economy will also send a powerful message about the American system:   Free people, free markets, free ideas … implemented faithfully… will set a powerful example of what’s possible to the rest of the world.  …   Our words and our actions must match – so that the entire world knows we say what we mean and mean what we say.   The Administration talks, but the words face.   They draw red lines … then erase them.   With grandiosity, they announce resets and disengage.   Hashtag campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement.   Personal diplomacy and maturity is replaced by leaks and personal disparagement:  …   The President’s word needs to be backed by the greatest military power in the world… The president should call on leaders of both parties to fix the budget and address the shortfalls in our defense spending.   He should show leadership – and commitment to solving the problem.  …   Having a military that is equal to any threat is not only essential for the commander in chief… it also makes it less likely that we will need to put our men and women in uniform in harm’s way.   Because I believe, fundamentally, that weakness invites war… and strength encourages peace.  …   The threats of the 21st century will not be the same as the threats of the 20th… and it is critical that we adapt to meet this challenge.  …   America does not have the luxury of withdrawing from the world – our security, our prosperity and our values demand that we remain engaged and involved in often distant places. We have no reason to apologize for our leadership and our interest in serving the cause of global security, global peace and human freedom.

At this time of unimaginable suffering, the country shares in their grief.”  The White House said the family received a "private message from Kayla’s ISIL captors" that included information confirming she had died.  Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the news heartbreaking. Kayla and her parents lived in Prescott, Ariz.  “I am heartbroken for the Mueller family at the loss of their beautiful, beloved daughter, Kayla,” McCain said in a statement. “The thoughts and prayers of the people of Arizona, America, and the civilized world are with the Mueller family at this terrible hour.”  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Mueller’s contributions will live on and “continue to inspire the lives she touched.”  “As we strengthen our resolve to bring justice to the brutal regime that has robbed a family of a beloved daughter, and loved ones of a trusted friend, we proudly celebrate Kayla Jean’s generosity of spirit,” Pelosi said.  Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Mueller represented the “best of American courage, compassion and selflessness – placing her own life at risk to advance human rights and common decency around the world.”  “With each new barbaric act, ISIL reminds us why it must be stopped. This scourge will come to an end, and we will hunt down those responsible for Kayla's captivity and death,” Schiff added.

Counting Sen. Ted Cruz, candidates and potential candidates now include at least one African-American, two women, two Cuban-Americans and three Catholics.  The field comes into view just a generation after John F. Kennedy defied political odds by winning the 1960 White House race amid a country still wary of his Roman Catholic religion.  Today, political talk about the potential candidacies of New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida GOP Gov. Jeb Bush or former Maryland Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley focuses less on their Catholic faith than on their economic and foreign policy.  “The field is just more reflective of where the country is demographically,” Matthew Dallek, an assistant political professor at George Washington University, said Monday.  He also said the potential Republican field looks “much more diverse” than in years past but that the diversity among the entire field is not unprecedented -- considering in part that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive 2016 White House Democratic front-runner, came close to winning the nomination in 2008 and Barack Obama that year was elected the country’s first black president.  Cruz’s announcement Monday makes him the first Latino major party presidential candidate since Democrat Bill Richardson in 2008.  Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who like Cruz is a Cuban-American, is expected to make his official announcement in April.  The history of female U.S. presidential candidates goes back to the late 1800s. But none has come closer than Clinton. Yet she may not be the only female contender on the field this time around. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina is weighing a Republican bid, and has trained much of her criticism in recent speeches on Clinton's tenure as secretary of state.  Republican and retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson is the only known African-American considering a 2016 presidential run.  Dan Holler, Heritage Action for America’s communications director, said Monday that diversity in the Republican field helps the party because it shows “everybody has the opportunity” to advance party policies.  “The more people making the case, the more receptive people are going to be to a Ted Cruz or a Carly Fiorina,” he said.  Though being Catholic is no longer considered a major hurdle toward becoming president, a candidate’s race and religion will likely continue to stir public debate.  "Were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ, I would have been raised by a single mother," Cruz said Monday in declaring his candidacy, describing his upbringing and how his father initially left when Cruz was a child but returned after finding religion.  Kennedy famously said two months before winning the White House, "I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters, and the Church does not speak for me."  In 2008 and 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who won the party nomination the second time, also was called upon to explain his Mormon faith but rarely brought up the issue, reportedly because advisers feared it would alienate some voters.  “Religion has become less of a flashpoint,” said Dallek, while arguing the topic would dominate more of the political debate if a Jewish or Muslim candidate became a major contender.  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who with Bush leads most early polls for the 2016 Republican nomination, is a member of a nondenominational evangelical church.  Bush is not of Hispanic descent but is married to a Mexican-American woman and has three Latino children. That Bush, Cruz and Rubio have a Latino or Hispanic background could be an advantage, considering the growth of that population across the country and the importance of winning their vote.  Obama won reelection in 2012 with roughly 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, compared with roughly 27 percent for Romney.

Weekly applications for unemployment aid dropped 21,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 283,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average of applications, a less volatile number, fell 6,500 to 289,750, its lowest level in 15 weeks.  Applications are a proxy for layoffs. They have been near or below 300,000 since September, a very low reading by historical standards that points to solid hiring. The average has dropped 16 percent in the past year.  The average is at its lowest level since late October. Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said that before then, the average hadn't been as low in more than 14 years.  "All in, this is an encouraging sign for February payrolls," she said.  That decline has coincided with much stronger job gains. Employers added more than 1 million jobs from November through January, the strongest three-month pace in 17 years.  More than 3.2 million jobs have been created in the past year. That has helped lower the unemployment rate to 5.7 percent in January from 6.6 percent 12 months earlier.  The strong job gains are showing signs of finally starting to lift paychecks for more workers. Average hourly pay rose 0.5 percent in January, the most in six years, the Labor Department said earlier this month. While economists cautioned against reading too much into one month's figure, it suggested employers may finally feel the need to raise wages to attract new workers and keep the ones they have.  Other reports also point to a strong job market. The number of available jobs posted by employers rose in December to a 14-year high, the government said last week.  The number of people quitting also picked up 2.1 percent from the previous month. More quits are a sign of confidence in the economy because people typically quit when they have another job lined up, usually at higher pay, or are optimistic that they can find a new position.  The number of people receiving benefits, meanwhile, rose to 2.4 million in the week ending February 7, the latest data available. That's down from 2.9 million a year ago.

id=155159, title=White House Warns Senate on Iran Legislation, url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/white-house-warns-senate-anew-iran-legislation-n323911, datepublished=2015-03-15 19:50:03, date=2015-03-15 20:44:33.397000, datesaved=2015-03-15 20:44:33.397000, text=WASHINGTON — The White House delivered a fresh warning to the Senate late Saturday to stay out of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, asserting that pending legislation would likely have a "profoundly negative impact" on the ongoing talks.  President Barack Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, told Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker in a letter that legislation sponsored by the Tennessee Republican would go far beyond ensuring a role for Congress in any deal with Iran.  "Instead, the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that Congress must vote to 'approve' any deal," McDonough said. He criticized a provision that would eliminate Obama's authority to lift some sanctions on Iran as part of any agreement.  The talks are to resume Sunday in Switzerland, with the U.S. and other world powers facing an end-of-March deadline to reach a framework deal.  "The administration's request to Congress is simple: Let us complete the negotiations before the Congress acts on legislation," McDonough said, adding that he does expect a robust congressional debate if a final deal is struck by the end of June.  McDonough reiterated Obama's repeated threats to veto the legislation should Congress pass it.  Corker and Senate colleagues in both parties insist that Congress be allowed to consider and vote on any agreement designed to block Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Corker argued his case in a letter to Obama earlier this week, and did so again in response to McDonough.  "On this issue where Congress has played such a vital role, I believe it is very important that Congress appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented," Corker said in a statement late Saturday.  Tensions between the administration and lawmakers over Iran have been rising for weeks.  McDonough's letter follows one this past week that was signed by 47 Republican senators and addressed to Iran's leaders warning that any nuclear agreement with the U.S. could expire the day Obama leaves office. The White House blasted the letter as a politically motivated attempt to undermine the president's ability to conduct foreign policy and advance U.S. national security interests.  The GOP letter followed a controversial March 3 speech to a joint meeting of Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he warned that the emerging nuclear agreement would all but guarantee that Iran gets nuclear weapons. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, invited the prime minister to speak without input from the White House and State Department, in what the White House said was a departure from protocol.  The Huffington Post first reported on McDonough's letter.

Sean Corr, an up-and-coming race car driver from upstate New York, decked out his race car with a mural featuring a Central Park horse-carriage driver to show support for the embattled industry.  The hood of his tan Ford Fusion — which he will race in on Saturday for the highly competitive Lucas Oil 200 — is decked with a drawing of a horse-carrige operator under the headline “New York Horse Power.”  It also features a Teamsters logo — which is the union that reps the drivers and is in a fierce battle with City Hall to protect the industry — and the hashtag “#Carriageon.”  “We had the open spot [on the hood] and I couldn’t think of a better cause to put on it,” said Corr.  He grew up on a horse farm in Goshen in Orange County and — through family connection in the tight-knit equine community — reached out to the industry to ask for a mural for the car during the race.  In addition to supporting a good cause, it also shows the world his connection to his home state.  “I like to show where we are from,” said Corr, whose team is called Empire Racing.  Corr said he frequently makes the hour-long journey from his home into Manhattan to visit and has fond memories of riding in the horse-drawn carriages as a kid.  He is deeply opposed to the industry ban Mayor de Blasio is pushing the City Council to enact. “It’s such a shame to hear what the mayor wants to do,” he said.  Like the majority of New Yorkers — who numerous polls show oppose the ban — he believes the city will lose an important connection to its past if the ban is enacted.  “When you think of Central Park, you think of the carriages,” he said. “It would take away so much.”  Even without the extra horse power on his car, Corr stands a good shot of winning the annual 200 mile race at the Daytona International Speedway, part of the Automobile Racing Club of America Racing series.  Last month, Corr was the fastest overall driver at testing when he clocked in at 187.692 mph. His Empire Racing teammates took in second and third places. 
id=144163, title=Why Republicans Wrote to the Ayatollahs, url=http://time.com/3738996/iran-senate-republicans-letter/, datepublished=2015-03-10 17:58:45, date=2015-03-10 18:27:34.011000, datesaved=2015-03-10 18:27:34.011000, text=The 47 Republican Senators who wrote to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran yesterday did so, they said, “to bring to your attention two features of our Constitution” which the Senators said limit how much President Obama can commit to in nuclear negotiations between Tehran, the U.S. and its five allies.  But to judge by his past statements about those negotiations, the letter’s primary author intended it not so much to edify the Iranians about the American system of government as to completely undermine the talks themselves.  Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas strongly opposes the nuclear talks and believes they should stop immediately. In January, he told the Heritage Foundation “the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran … started out as an unwise policy [and have] now descended into a dangerous farce.”  In his Heritage speech, Cotton suggested that Obama might have cut a quiet deal to push off Iranian nuclear weapons capability until after the end of his second term. Cotton said that the President, in writing to Iran’s supreme leader over the last several years in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear impasse, had behaved “like a love-struck teenager.”  By contrast, Cotton informed the Iranian leaders in his letter Monday that any deal Obama cut with them might not last. “We will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement,” Cotton and his fellow Senators wrote. “The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time,” the Republican Senators added.  Cotton has thoughts on what an alternative policy should be. In his Heritage speech, he said the U.S. should focus first and foremost on bringing down the regime in Tehran. “The goal of our policy must be clear: regime change in Iran,” Cotton said. To that end, Cotton said, the U.S. Congress should offer to transfer bombers and 30,000 pound bunker busting bombs to Israel for use should Israel decide to attack Iranian nuclear sites.  Not all the Republicans agree with that policy. Seven Republican Senators did not sign the letter, although they have not all stated their reasons. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has previously argued that Israeli military strikes against Iran could draw the U.S. unprepared into war. Cotton served in Iraq and Afghanistan, but after two long and costly wars few politicians are willing publicly to embrace policies that could drag the U.S. into another Middle East conflict.  Which may explain why Cotton and his fellow signatories ended their letter to the Iranians by saying only that, “We hope this letter enriches your knowledge of our constitutional system and promotes mutual understanding and clarity as nuclear negotiations progress.”

That federal Obamacare health insurance marketplace that now serves 37 states, and so far this year has seen sign-ups by more than 6 million people who qualify for subsidies.    Just 14 percent of respondents to the poll said they knew "some" or "a lot" about the case targeting that aid, which is available to Obamacare customers with low or moderate incomes, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  But 64 percent of respondents agreed with the idea that "Congress should pass a law" to restore the HealthCare.gov subsidies if the Supreme Court said the ACA as written does not allow them. While Democrats and self-described independents were the most supportive of that view, 40 percent of Republican respondents said Congress should pass such legislation as a remedy.  In states served by HealthCare.gov, 59 percent of people said they would want their state to create its own Obamacare exchange in the face of a high court decision ruling the federal exchange subsidies are illegal. And a slight majority of Republicans in those states, 51 percent, agreed that their state should take such action.  The vast majority of people who buy Obamacare plans on government-run exchanges qualify for subsidies, or federal tax credits, to help them pay their monthly insurance premiums. If those subsidies are not available, there is widespread agreement among insurance experts that enrollment in Obamacare plans would plummet dramatically because many people would find their retail prices unaffordable.  In the pending Supreme Court case, plaintiffs argue that the ACA, as written, only allows such subsidies to be issued to customers of one of the 14 insurance exchanges established by individual states and the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs say that the aid is not an option for HealthCare.gov customers because the ACA only explicitly authorizes subsidies to customers of an exchange established by a "state."  The Obama administration disputes that view, and has said it is confident the subsidies will continue for HealthCare.gov customers.  The Supreme Court is due to hear arguments in the case March 4, and is likely to rule on the issue in June.

"It's very early, but he's being encouraged to seriously consider bringing the people's voice to the U.S. Senate," Crist adviser Kevin Cate said. "And he always listens closely to Floridians."  Crist has been "making calls" about the Senate race to Democrats and financial supporters in recent weeks, two Florida Democratic sources said.  But Cate's comment is the first on-the-record signal from the Crist orbit that he might mount another statewide bid.  Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who defeated Crist in 2010, is up for re-election in 2016 but is likely to run for the Republican presidential nomination.  Ever since he quit the Republican Party in 2010 after his Senate bid flat-lined in a GOP primary against Rubio, critics have ridiculed Crist as a finger-in-the-wind political shape-shifter.  But even with his perma-candidate reputation, Crist mounted another credible campaign as a Democrat in 2014 against Florida Gov. Rick Scott, narrowly losing to the incumbent despite being massively outspent on television in a midterm year that saw low turnout among Democrats.  If Crist runs, he would likely not be alone in the Democratic field. Several Democrats in Florida are considering Senate runs, including Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, and Rep. Patrick Murphy.  Reps. Alan Grayson, Kathy Castor and Gwen Graham have also been mentioned as possible candidates on the Democratic side.  But among the Democrats eyeing a run, only Crist would be able to hit the ground running immediately with name recognition, statewide campaign experience and national fundraising connections.

Legislators in Indiana and Arkansas were the latest to find out this hard truth. In an increasingly contentious world, it is vital to know that in a policy skirmish, the victors are usually the groups that were most prescient in establishing their question as the focus of debate in the arena where they will fare the best.  Those who thought that social media would only be energized by issues related to the Internet or popular culture were proven wrong. Motivated individuals used social media to change the question in this instance from freedom of religion to tolerance and activated public opinion to prompt Apple and Walmart to speak out against legislation in Indiana and Arkansas.  Social conservatives chose the question, "Should we protect religious freedom, one of our cherished First Amendment rights?" and selected the venue of legislatures in generally conservative states. Gay rights activists saw an opportunity and changed the question and the arena. Their question was "Should we condone prejudice?" and asked it in the arena of public opinion, not just in Indiana and Arkansas but around the world.  Apple CEO Tim Cook, someone with a strong personal interest in the matter, took an assertive stand by writing an op-ed criticizing the legislation in Indiana. This is likely to be a net advantage to the company, given that the younger and more upscale demographic profile of its customer base is more likely to be supportive. My former colleague, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, referenced his son's opposition while announcing his request for the legislature to alter the law, seemingly confirming Apple's calculation.  Walmart's decision to weigh in on the topic clearly allows the company to burnish its inclusiveness credentials but could be a double-edged sword. By showing that the corporation has a powerful impact on legislation, particularly in its home state of Arkansas, it will be subject to increased pressure to get involved in future disputes. Activists will have greater standing to assert that Walmart's lack of action on other issues reflects the company's tacit approval. That is why it is essential for every company to limit its political engagement to only those activities essential to its business purpose, one that benefits both its bottom line and society.  In these cases, Apple, Walmart, and a string of other companies engaged on this issue in an effort to shape the debate. The commercial soundness of such actions depends on the unique circumstances of each company.  The conservative activist response was largely responding to the question advanced by the opposition rather than coming up with a better question. That is a losing strategy.  George Will directing his ire at Apple's "selective indignation" based on its operations in countries with a poor record of inclusiveness like Saudi Arabia may play well to the conservative base but is an example of answering the opposition's questions. Laura Ingram's effort to advance the question "Should people in America be coerced to agree with popular sentiment?" was a more productive effort to promote a more appealing question.  Whichever side of this issue you favor, this is a prime example of how politics trumps policy. Perhaps if the legislators in Arkansas and Indiana had taken my new free online course "Business in a Political Age," they would have charted a more effective course.  Facing the power of the Internet to change the question and energize the arena of public opinion is the new norm in politics. It is essential for anyone wishing to shape the world to have strategies that address this reality.  Hon. Mark R.

Brad Ashford (D-Neb.) became the newest lawmaker to sign on as a co-sponsor to an anti-online gaming bill backed by Adelson. In fact, Ashford was the only congressman to sign on Tuesday. The other 13 co-sponsors had signed on in the weeks prior.  So Ashford and Miriam Adelson would have had something to talk about when she called him Wednesday to apologize for accidentally knocking her purse off the House gallery railing edge while attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech and hitting the Democrat.  Ashford’s spokesman said that “the call wasn’t at all necessary, but [Ashford] appreciated the opportunity to talk with her.” He described it as a great conversation and said she was “very kind and gracious.”  The congressman had decided to sign on to the Adelson bill before “pursegate,” the spokeman said.  The bill, introduced in early February, would ban online gambling. Adelson, owner of the Las Vegas Sands company, has been wielding his tremendous influence to get congressional backers because Internet betting threatens his casino customer base. The federal government has left it up to the states, but, curiously, some Republicans think it should be regulated by the feds.  Many conservative Republicans, however, say it should remain a state rights issue. It’s a complicated area for the GOP, considering that Adelson and his wife contributed almost $6 million to federal candidates in the 2014 midterms and ranked eighth in all individual donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  But for Ashford, it won’t be purse strings that connect him to the Adelsons. It will just be a purse.

In its April issue, GQ magazine features a profile prospective presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson, the retired head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins and the first African-American to run a division there. Though Carson has never held elected office, his unapologetic conservatism and up-from-poverty story have excited much of the base, and GQ's piece, which shadows Carson on a trip to Israel, watching the State of the Union, and reflecting on his media reputation as he gears up for a likely presidential run, captures both the positive and negative aspects of his potential candidacy. Some of the most buzz-generating moments:  "What is the role of the Knesset?" Carson asked his Israeli guide of the country's one-chamber legislature. The occasion was a Christmastime trip in 2014, his first to the nation that almost all presidential hopefuls visit. The guide explained its working and Israel's political parties. "It sounds complex," he said. "Why don't they just adopt the system we have?"  Last year, Carson drew criticism for suggesting that liberals could turn American into Nazi Germany, and stating that the U.S. was "very much like Nazi Germany" because people were afraid to say what they believed, according to CNN. Sitting at the cafeteria of Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, during the Israel trip, Carson was asked if the visit prompted him to reconsider the comparison. "Not at all," he said. "It makes it even stronger."  The secretary of state Carson most admires is Condoleezza Rice, while, as for defense secretaries, he likes Robert Gates. When asked to name his favorite secretary of the treasury, he paused.  In his youth, he was a "radical" Democrat but became a Republican during Reagan's presidency. He then left the party and became an conservative-minded independent during the Clinton impeachment because he felt that Congressional Republicans who had had their own dalliances were being hypocritical. He only re-registered with the party in 2014. "If I weren't thinking about running for office, I would remain an independent," he said.  The Draft Carson Super PAC has raised more than $13 million, compared to the $9 Ready for Hillary raised last year. Carson also brought in $6 million for the American Legacy PAC, which tapped him to fund-raise for its Obamacare repeal program. Because Carson has worked with a long list of causes, his likely campaign manager, Terry Giles, predicts his mailing list could have more than 2 million names on it. "If I can get $100 from 1.5 million people," Giles said, "I'll have $150 million for the first four primaries, and we'll be extremely competitive." (Jeb Bush, who is considered the Republican fundraising front runner, hopes to raise $100 million.)  Carson watched 2015's State of the Union address at the Washington home of an adviser, who said the president looked "elegant" in his white shirt and sky blue tie. "Like most psychopaths," Carson responded. "That's why they're successful. That's the way they look. They all look great." When the adviser, Armstrong Williams, said the president had to "convince people to believe him" the same way Carson would, the doctor said the difference was that Obama was lying. "He's trying to sell what he thinks is not true!" Carson said. "He's sitting there saying, 'These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.'" Armstrong warned Carson off that kind of rhetoric in his post-speech appearances.  Speaking about same-sex marriage in 2013, he also said gays and other groups like "people who believe in bestiality" couldn't change the definition of the institution, according to ABC News. Later that year, Carson said he thought the Affordable Care Act was "the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery," according to the Washington Post.

It was about control." In the profile, he waved off the strong condemnations these and other comments sparked. "We've reached a point where if you say the word 'slavery' or you say the word 'bestiality,' it's like you've sprayed a fly with Raid—people start spinning, and they just can't function anymore," he said.

A number of folks got all excited because I hadn't shown exactly why the Logan Act was a joke. I offered a link to Lawrence O'Donnell's complete trashing of this meme, but some didn't want to use the link, perhaps because it required users to sign in to the MSNBC site. So for those who want to hear the whole argument spelled out, I offer this link to Joshua Keating's article in Slate, "The Law Tom Cotton Supposedly Violated is a Joke", here.  It's complicated because understanding an ancient federal statute written for a totally different purpose requires more than being able to read the words in the statute as if they were plain English. The people at the top at MoveOn.org and at Occupy Democrats, the two places pushing this meme, should have known better than to make a big deal about this obscurity. But when we fall into the rabbit hole of extreme partisanship, strange things happen. Otherwise reasonable people can get very unreasonable indeed.  Some accused me in the comments of being condescending in my previous post, so let me put what I say about hyper-partisanship, like calling the folks you disagree with evil, or labeling dumb stuff as treasonous, into a context. All have sinned in terms of political hyperbole and over-the-top partisanship, including me. I have a long history of political activism as a progressive, union-loving, racism-fighting, women's rights Democrat. Once I was even talked into running for Congress by the leader of my state's Democratic party; that's before I studied political science and didn't know any better. You can look me up in the Almanac of American Politics, Nebraska's First CD, 1984. I got totally shellacked by then-incumbent Doug Bereuter, running in one of the most Republican House districts in the country, in the Reagan re-election year. It was a humbling experience.  When I ran for Congress, I was desperate for any argument against the incumbent, and used a lot of hyperbole. The more I got attacked, the more I wanted to fight back. It's easy to cross the line when you feel passionately about things. But I didn't call him the Anti-Christ or accuse him of treason, maybe because I'm from Nebraska, and we aren't exactly known for gutter politics. We're the only state in the Union with a non-partisan state legislature. Up until recently, our Democrats sounded a bit like moderate Republicans, and our Republicans were closer to Eisenhower in tone than to Bill O'Reilly. Chuck Hegel, who served as Obama's Secretary of Defense, was one of our typical Republican senators. Former senator Bob Kerrey, a pretty conservative Democrat on many issues, is also one of ours.  Here was my real point in my previous post: when we start screaming "treason" and calling for people to be arrested and brought up on charges, we liberals take the focus off real arguments. And these are important arguments! It's important to explain why a strong agreement with Iran, coupled with frequent inspections, is crucial not just for stopping an Iranian nuclear weapons program before it exists, but for better relations with Iran, whose Shia militias are doing a pretty good job in disposing of the Sunni militants in ISIL.  Instead of debating an unenforceable law that wouldn't stand up to a Constitutional challenge based on First Amendment rights to free speech, the focus should be on the possibility of an agreement. Republicans line up lock-step with Netanyahu against it, based on an outdated 1979 picture of the nation of Iran. The Iranian government seems to be run completely by religious extremists, but that is just on the surface. There are modernizing influences, and moderating influences, which give the United States and our European allies a chance for success. Sanctions have hurt the Iranians, and some influential Iranians in the business community are nearly giddy at the prospect of getting them lifted. There is a lot at stake.  When the 47 Republican senators made fools out of themselves, I suggest that the better strategy was to let the world see just how foolish their behavior was, because they stood against something important for the national security of the United States, and the peace of the world. And in addition, they inserted themselves in the middle of foreign policy in such a way as to make our allies and our foes doubt the ability of the United States to lead on the world stage on any front, all because they wanted to embarrass President Obama. Way to be mature grown-ups, Republican senators. Way to go. That was the story, until liberal partisan activists got out over their skis pushing a ridiculous meme.  I know some people get a great deal of satisfaction from calling political opponents treasonous, regardless as to whether the actions rise to the level of treason under law. That's their right, they can happily sling mud all they want. We have freedom of speech in this country, hurrah. But is is highly debatable to suggest, as several people have in the reply section of my previous post, that this is the most effective way to "fight fire with fire." Liberals were winning here, on the issue of an agreement with Iran, and this distraction about the Logan Act changed the focus from policy, where our arguments can be persuasive, to an attack that Republicans can use for fundraising. Marco Rubio has already sent emails to his donors, asking for help to defend poor Marco from attacks on his patriotism. Help, they are accusing me of treason! Please send money!  For those of you who remain unconvinced, just watch and wait. If the day comes when a Republican senator gets charged under the Logan Act, you can have a good laugh at my expense. But if that never happens, because the law is, as Joshua Keating said, "a joke," then you might want to stop and think a little harder before you sign the next petition.

Identical letters circulated by Run Warren Run, organized by liberal groups MoveOn.org Political Action and Democracy for America, gained more than two dozen signatures in New Hampshire and 16 signatures in Iowa from a mix of Democratic county chairmen, and former and current lawmakers.  “Contested caucuses test and strengthen candidates and ensure progressives have a chance to make our voices heard,” the letter said. “Having a real debate is what democracy is all about. That’s why Americans from all walks of life have risen up to encourage Senator Elizabeth Warren to run for president.”  “Sen. Warren is a fighter for middle-class and working families who has stood up to the corporate interests and Wall Street banks. I urge Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016,” it said.  In New Hampshire, 24 Democratic members of the state legislature and four former Democratic members of the legislature signed the letter, according to WMUR.  In Iowa, letter signatories include former state Rep. Ed Fallon, a former gubernatorial candidate; Johnson County Supervisor Mike Carberry; four current county Democratic party chairs; one county Democratic central committee member; a former Democratic state central committee member; and two former county Democratic chairmen, the Des Moines Register reported. The remainder of signatures were from activists around the state.  Warren trails far behind presumed frontrunner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and has repeatedly said she will not run for president.

The request was reportedly made by French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve during a one-day visit to San Francisco, where he met with representatives from the U.S. tech firms.  “Today, 90 percent of those who commit terrorist acts in the European Union do so after attending radical websites,” Cazeneuve was quoted by France Soir, according to Sputnik News.  "We emphasized that when an investigation is underway we don't want to go through the usual government to government channels, which can take so long," Cazeneuve reportedly said. “It's important to have full cooperation and quick reaction.”  Cazeneuve reportedly said that Friday's meeting was part of an effort by the French government to build a strong relationship with the tech companies.  "I told them we can figure this out together, we can come up with counterterrorism speech and block these sites that are enticing the most vulnerable members of our society to commit terrorist acts," Cazeneuve said, according to The Associated Press (AP).  A spokesperson for Facebook told AP that the company was working "aggressively" to ensure that the social media website did not become a platform for extremists, by removing any content that "praises or supports terrorism."  "We regularly host ministers and other governmental officials from across the world at Facebook, and were happy to welcome Mr. Cazeneuve today," the unnamed spokesperson reportedly said.  The comments from Cazeneuve come just over a month after a series of attacks in Paris claimed the lives of 20 people, including three militants. French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket were attacked by gunmen, allegedly affiliated with al Qaeda, in January. The attackers, including the brothers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, were killed after a massive manhunt. 
id=217485, title=Hillary Clinton to give 2016 race a jolt with announcement set for Sunday, url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/10/hillary-clinton-2016-election-announcement, datepublished=2015-04-10 20:18:50, date=2015-04-11 01:48:29.455000, datesaved=2015-04-11 01:48:29.455000, text=Hillary Clinton will fire the starting pistol on the 2016 US presidential race this weekend with an unusual online declaration that attempts to jolt new energy into a campaign already in danger of seeming tired before it begins.  The former secretary of state has been widely tipped for months to seek the Democratic party nomination – her second attempt after losing to Barack Obama in 2008 – but is due to confirm her candidacy with a Twitter announcement at noon on Sunday, according to source familiar with the plan.  Despite eschewing the standard home-state rally or visit to a symbolic national landmark to make her declaration, Clinton will follow a more traditional route next week by visiting Iowa, which will be the first state to vote for nominees early next February.  Her stops are expected to be at smaller venues rather than the glitzy launches by Republican rivals senator Rand Paul and Ted Cruz over the last two weeks as her team seeks to manage her entry into a race that many had come to view as a forgone conclusion.  The lack of serious rivals among other Democrats means Clinton’s opponents are already focusing almost as much attention on attacking her as they are fighting their own, much more competitive, primary race.  Paul, for example, has been particularly active since his declaration in Kentucky on Tuesday, questioning Clinton’s record on Benghazi during an interview with the Guardian and tweeting regularly about his ability to defeat her.  The imminent entry of other Republicans into the race, starting with Marco Rubio on Monday, is likely to intensify interest in the primaries despite next November’s general election still being some 587 days away.  Many candidates have chosen the beginning of April for their formal campaign launches to maximise the amount of time they can raise money before they have to report fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission at the end of the second quarter.    An early start certainly helped Cruz, who raised an estimated $10m in the days becoming the first to declare that he was seeking the Republican nomination.  But the phoney war before this April starting point, during which time no major candidate declared themselves to be running but many were touring crucial states like Iowa and New Hampshire has raised criticism from transparency campaigners who claim they were flouting FEC guidelines.  Several Democrats are still expected to join the race too. Lincoln Chafee, a former Rhode Island senator and governor, announced on Thursday that he was considering a run for the presidency.  Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley is also expected to mount a serious challenge from the left, and held an event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wendesday night that many interpreted as a step up in his campaigning.  Independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has also said he is considering a run, probably for the Democratic nomination, although privately staff say his enthusiasm has faded recently, perhaps due to a relative lack of support among potential backers.  Polls and anecdotal evidence suggest Clinton remains a clear favourite among party leaders, financial backers and potential Democratic voters and her bigger worry is convincing voters that she is not taking the party’s nomination for granted.  A similar head-start during the 2008 primary quickly evaporated after she lost in the Iowa caucuses to both Barack Obama and John Edwards – a fate her team are anxious to avoid by stressing the more humble start to this campaign.  Nonetheless, the intense media interest around the more competitive Republican primary does appear to be having an effect on early voting intentions, with one poll in Iowa, Colorado and New Hampshire suggesting she has slipped behind Paul.  The entry of Republican heavyweight and favourite of the party establishment, Jeb Bush, may also test the Hillary camp’s determination to remain low key.  She is also under pressure to outline more concrete policy prescriptions, having been attacked from both the right and the left for being insufficiently transparent about her intentions if she were to return to the White House as president.  Unfortunately for her campaign, more attention has also been focused on her alleged lack of transparency of emails during her time as secretary of state, following disclosures that she used a private account rather than a State Department one.  Instead, Hillary supporters will be looking to start afresh in Iowa next week with a campaign that focuses on her experience, likely success against more extreme Republican candidates and ability to provide some of the same the history-making dynamism of the Obama team by becoming the first female president of the United States.

"I was notified verbally that due to a complaint from your office I was fired," wrote Rodner Figueroa in the letter, which was directed to Mrs. Obama.  The network, though, says it received no such complaint.  "We did not receive a call from the White House or from the first lady's office," a Univision executive told CBS News. "The incident happened Wednesday afternoon. The decision to fire him was made that same day, and the next day, when we issued the statement, we actually sent the statement to the first lady's office to notify them."  Another person at Univision with knowledge of the situation backed up that account. "Univision called the White House on Thursday morning to alert them of what happened," the person said. "They did not call us, we called them."  The first lady's office declined to comment.  Figueroa, the host of "El Gordo y la Flaca," said during Wednesday's broadcast, "Michelle Obama looks like she's from the cast of 'Planet of the Apes.'" The comment came during a segment analyzing the work of a make-up artist who made himself look like Michelle Obama, among other female celebrities.  In his letter to the first lady, Figueroa repeatedly apologized, saying he is embarrassed and there is "no excuse" for his offensive remark. But he insisted he's not a racist.  "I take responsibility for this lack of judgment," he wrote," but I can't accept that I am being called a racist, and being fired for that reason, and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years."  Figueroa said he comes from a bi-racial family, noting that his father was Afro-Latino. He also cited his own experience as a minority in America.  "I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that his openly gay, and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities who have been discriminated against just like me," he wrote.  "I openly voted twice for your husband Barack Obama," he added, "because I consider him a great man that respects minorities like me in this country."

It says the size of the U.S. troop presence for 2016 will be decided later this year.  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had asked Obama to slow the withdrawal of U.S. troops from his country. That's because Afghan security forces are bracing for a tough spring fighting season and are also contending with Islamic State fighters looking to recruit on their soil.  The original plan was to cut the 9,800 troops to 5,500 by the end of this year.  Obama was to make the announcement at a news conference Tuesday after his first Oval Office meeting with Afghanistan's new leader.

But the rapid change in public opinion may obscure another fact: Large areas of the country remain overwhelmingly opposed to same-sex marriage, with little sign of change.  Alabama is one of those places, and the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court this weekend encouraged probate judges there to defy a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  The emerging national majority in favor of same-sex marriage is built on high levels of support in well-educated metropolitan areas, like Seattle, Washington, Minneapolis and Raleigh, N.C. But even in states where voters approved same-sex marriage in 2012 — Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington — rural voters in those states opposed it by a wide margin, often by a wider one than they opposed President Obama.  The stark divide between well-educated and less-educated areas is perhaps most clearly illustrated in North Carolina, which has growing, well-educated metropolitan areas with many new arrivals from other states as well as a rural population with more culturally conservative native Southerners. In 2012, the state considered a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and civil unions, and the result was a very polarized electorate.  Nowhere in the country have voters more strongly opposed a ban on same-sex marriage ban than Orange County, home to Chapel Hill, where voters rejected such a ban by a 79-to-21 margin. Yet in Graham County, a few hours to the west in the Appalachian Mountains, voters supported the ban by a margin of 89 to 11. Graham County was joined by 16 other rural counties where the ban received at least 80 percent of the vote. The same pattern held in the Northern states where same-sex marriage ultimately prevailed in November 2012.  Those results suggest that Alabama would have voted overwhelmingly against same-sex marriage if it had been on the ballot there in 2012. I estimate the vote would have been roughly 73 percent to 27 percent against same-sex marriage. The estimate is based on the relationship between support for same-sex marriage in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington; educational attainment; population density; the number of evangelical Christians and African-Americans; and support for Mr. Obama.  Support for same-sex marriage has increased further over the last two years, rising to about 54 percent last year from 49 percent in 2012, according to Pew and Gallup national polls. Nonetheless, a majority — and probably two-thirds — of Alabama voters most likely remain opposed.  The continued, overwhelming opposition of evangelical Christians is the main explanation. A Pew Research survey in 2014 found that just 21 percent of white evangelical Christians supported same-sex marriage. That’s up from 14 percent in 2004, but it means that states with a large number of evangelical Christians — like Alabama — will probably continue to oppose same-sex marriage for a long time. If the Supreme Court rules this year that same-sex marriage bans are constitutional, such bans could endure in the South for years or even decades.

But first, he has to make it to South Carolina, Utah and South Dakota. (Note: He has been to these states while on the campaign trail, but not for a presidential visit.)  Here's a peek at some of the things Obama has been missing out on during his presidency:  The walls are made of concrete, but they're redecorated each year with new murals made of corn and other grains and grasses. The palace is currently undergoing renovations until April -- though it remains open for visitors -- so the president might want to check it out this summer.  This juice bar in Vernal could help quench the president's thirst -- as long as he's willing to pay the $1 surcharge.  Obama won't have to change his weekend schedule for this trip. Just hop on Air Force One and play his Sunday golf game on or around Hilton Head Island.  Some of the country's best national parks are in these states. South Dakota touts Badlands National Park as well as the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, where Obama can gave up at some of his predecessors. Utah has what it calls "The Mighty 5" national parks: Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion.  These states consistently have some of the lowest gas prices in the nation, so the presidential motorcade can fuel up on the cheap.  This 76,000-square-foot attraction includes plenty of tourist treasures and Western wear for Obama to bring back to Washington, D.C. There's also an arcade, animated Tyrannosaurus rex and train station water show.  The quaint, historic downtown offers a tranquility Obama can't find in D.C. as he's battling congressional Republicans. While he's in Charleston, he should stop at Husk, a restaurant from James Beard Award-winning Chef Sean Brock that serves life-changing pimento cheese. The first lady would probably even approve of this dish.  This annual motorcycle spectacle celebrates its 75th year in August. Hundreds of thousands of people flock to this small town of 6,400 and the surrounding area for the rally.  A presidential appearance at this legacy of the 2002 Winter Olympics could give athletes-in-training a boost for 2018.  Watch the video above for more on what Obama could see and do.

The ad, titled “Rigged,” went live on Sunday and alleged that Clinton would have a conflict of interest if she were president because the Clinton Foundation, the group founded by former President Bill Clinton and which Hillary became involved with after stepping down as secretary of state, accepts donations from foreign governments.  “Powerful interests have tried to capture Washington and rig the system in their favor. The power of well-funded special interests tilts our democracy away from the people and toward the powerful,” Warren says as images of Hillary Clinton are shown with Middle Eastern leaders. The ad from American Crossroads, which backs Republican candidates, claimed the Clinton Foundation “took millions from foreign governments,” including up to $5 million from the United Arab Emirates, up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia and “potentially millions from Qatar,” which American Crossroads describes as “a prominent backer of Hamas,” the Palestinian militant group. Warren’s voice continues:  “Action is required to defend our great democracy against those that would see it perverted into one more rigged game where the rich and the powerful always win.”  Progressive Democrats are urging Warren to run for president, but the Massachusetts senator has consistently denied that she’ll mount a 2016 campaign. American Crossroads acknowledges that it uses Warren’s voice in its ad, but unless the watcher is aware that American Crossroads backs Republican candidates, it may be unclear if it actually came from Warren. American Crossroads’ leadership includes Mike Duncan, a former Republican National Committee chairman, and Steven Law, deputy labor secretary under former President George W. Bush and an ex-staffer to Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.  The screen then goes dark, followed by the words, “Powerful Foreign Governments are Ready for Hillary,” a take on the Ready for Hillary Super PAC that is gearing up for a 2016 run by the former secretary of state. “Are We?”  The ad isn’t the first attacking Hillary Clinton. An attack that more clearly comes from the GOP was launched last month that goes after the former first lady for her sky-high fees on the speaking circuit. Watch the ad below:

(Photo by Andre Chung) | The Washington Post via Getty Images  Journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, Politico and The Atlantic are among those who won George Polk Awards for "investigative and enterprising reporting" in 2014, Long Island University announced in a press release Sunday.  The Times' foreign correspondent Rukmini Callimachi won the award for international reporting with her "explosive account" of how European countries continue to pay al Qaeda millions of dollars in ransom despite denying the practice. The paper was also honored for its health reporting during the Ebola crisis, and shared an award for justice reporting with the Miami Herald for detailing inmate abuse within the U.S. prison system.  For Politico Magazine, independent journalist Rania Abouzeid won the foreign reporting award for her piece “The Jihad Next Door," which gave "an extensive and authoritative account of the rise of the Islamic State," and The Washington Post's Carol Leonnig's investigation into a series of security blunders at the Secret Service was recognized for national reporting.  Though The New York Times points out that the Polk Awards do not always recognize excellence in commentary, The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates won the award for his cover story “The Case for Reparations.” Published in June, the piece examined the progression of institutionalized racism in American history and was a finalist for a 2015 National Magazine Award in essays and criticism. According to The Times, John Darnton, the curator of the Polk Awards, decided to give an award for commentary because Coates “drives home his arguments very, very forcefully.”  “It’s a tremendous honor to receive the Polk Award," Coates said in a statement. "I take it as recognition for the tremendous effort and investment The Atlantic has put into pushing new ideas into the mainstream backed by thorough research and reporting."  The creator of the popular "Doonesbury" comic strip, Garry Trudeau, won the program's career award, making him the first cartoonist in history to do so.  "He has cut political pretension down to the size of his Doonesbury comic strip for 45 years," the announcement read.  The decision to make Trudeau the 33rd recipient of the award was largely seen as a showing of solidarity with the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists who were killed during a terrorist attack in Paris on Jan. 7.

"I think he's well qualified. He's going to have to do well. He's going to have to defend the president, but not to a fault," Senator Lindsey Graham, a key committee member, told Reuters.  Carter was nominated to become Obama's fourth defense secretary after Hagel resigned under pressure last year, raising questions over whether the 60-year-old technocrat would be able break into Obama's tight-knit inner circle. Hagel remains in the job until his successor is confirmed.  In an opening statement Carter is due to read on Wednesday morning, obtained by Reuters, he promised to give Obama his "most candid strategic advice" about the dangers ahead.  Carter also said in written answers to questions due to be publicly released on Wednesday that he's willing to consider recommending changes to Obama's drawdown plans in Afghanistan next year, should conditions deteriorate.  That could appeal to some Republicans who criticize Obama for setting drawdown targets based on what they say is a political calendar instead of security after 13 years of war.  Carter also expressed interest in expanding counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan and advancing efforts to arm and integrate Sunni tribal forces into Iraq's battle against Islamic State militants.  Still, it remains to be seen whether Carter will depart from longstanding Obama administration positions. Carter is an administration insider who has toiled away in high-ranking positions within the Pentagon in recent years.  His roles include deputy defense secretary -- the Pentagon's No. 2 job -- from 2011 to 2013 and the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer from 2009-11 when he led a major restructuring of the F-35 fighter jet program.  "I would think we will see more of continuity than we will see divergence," said William Perry, a former U.S. defense secretary and mentor to Carter.  Carter’s hearing will be closely watched by Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and other big weapons makers, which are waiting for clues about Carter's priorities and his commitment to new procurement programs, including a new long-range bomber and the Air Force One replacement.  Like Hagel, Carter criticized across-the-board spending cuts imposed by Congress but also singled out the need for greater reform of defense spending, already underway.  "I cannot suggest support and stability for the defense budget without at the same time frankly noting that not every defense dollar is spent as well as it should be," he says in prepared opening remarks.

Bobby Jindal (R) challenged his party's leaders in Congress to get over what he dismissively diagnosed as "post-election stress syndrome" and immediately pass an alternative to the health-care law and make other progress on conservative priorities.  In an address here Saturday to the Club for Growth, an advocacy group that long has been an antagonist to establishment Republican leaders, Jindal said he had grown impatient with the slow pace of progress of the GOP's new Senate majority and expanded House majority.  "It's not just a fight with Democrats, but with some Republicans, as well," said Jindal, a likely 2016 presidential candidate. "When we say, 'We want to repeal Obamacare,' we mean every single word...What was the point of getting these majorities if we weren't even going to try to fight for these principles?"  Later, talking with reporters, Jindal's criticism was even more pointed.  "They campaigned telling us, 'Give us the majority and we’ll do something with it,' " Jindal told reporters. "I don’t remember the TV ads saying, 'Give us the majority and we’ll do nothing for two years.' That would be a different TV ad. I’m not sure that would’ve been as inspiring or successful, quite frankly.  "They said, 'Give us the majority, we’ll repeal Obamacare,' " he continued. "They said, 'Give us the majority, we’ll stop amnesty. Give us the majority, we’ll roll back the growth in the federal government.' This is their chance to lead."  Jindal also had sharp words for Republicans who advocate a new economic agenda crafted to provide more opportunities for middle-class workers and thus expand the GOP's appeal ahead of the 2016 presidential election.  "They say, 'Look, Reaganomics was good for back then, but now it's time for us to do other things, especially because we're fighting for the middle class,' " Jindal said. "I've got an idea. Instead of trying to abandon supply-side economics, why don't we actually try to implement them for once."

While the arguments remain familiar, the legislative battles are taking place in the shadow of high-profile mass shootings that have occurred around the nation in recent years.  Colorado policymakers debated seven bills over gun control this week, with narrow defeats for four proposals in the Democrat-controlled House. Republicans, who won a slim majority in the Senate during last November’s elections, advanced two Senate bills -- one repealing a requirement for background checks for anyone transferring possession of a firearm, and another authorizing concealed carry for anyone authorized to carry a handgun. The measures are expected to fail in the House or be vetoed by the Democratic governor, however. Republican lawmakers in Colorado told the New York Times they were committed to the ideology of gun ownership championed by the party.  Families of victims of mass shootings appeared before state lawmakers earlier in the week to detail accounts of the shattering effect gun violence has had on their lives. Relatives of those who had died in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, the 2012 Aurora theater shooting and the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting testified before the congressional committees to persuade them not to relax restrictions on gun ownership.  All five Republican-sponsored bills debated by the House were defeated, including one that would have repealed a ban on owning high-capacity ammunition magazines. The bills were all aimed at repealing gun control measures that had been instated in 2013.  The bills attracted nationwide attention particularly in light of the mass shootings that have dominated headlines in recent years. Meanwhile, jury selection is underway for the trial of James Holmes, who perpetrated the Aurora theater shooting in Colorado that resulted in 12 deaths. 
id=167270, title=Budget spat leaves House GOP leaders facing new discord, url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/politics/article/Budget-spat-leaves-House-GOP-leaders-facing-new-6146915.php, datepublished=2015-03-20 08:13:08, date=2015-03-20 08:48:56.605000, datesaved=2015-03-20 08:48:56.605000, text=WASHINGTON (AP) — Whether the issue is immigration or federal budgets, Republicans keep learning a bitter lesson: Their sizable and near-historic congressional majority doesn't necessarily mean they can govern.  House Republican leaders confronted that truth again this week when fiscal conservatives unexpectedly blocked a leadership plan for the new federal budget.  The struggle, which pits Republicans who want a more robust military against those bent on cutting spending, will have to be resolved later in the full House.  Even if that happens, however, lawmakers say GOP leaders will still confront deep ideological divisions that could wreak chaos later this year when it's time to raise the debt ceiling, fund the government and address other big issues that fire up conservative talk shows.  GOP leaders lack some of the disciplinary tools their predecessors had, colleagues say. And a significant number of House Republicans have little incentive to bend because they are elected by fiercely conservative voters who detest political compromise.  It's "a different time," said 10-term GOP Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, who doesn't always support House leaders but sympathizes with their struggles. "It's a tougher job than it was back then to pull together a working majority."  Chabot cited outside groups that scrutinize "every vote and everything we do" and are quick to declare "we're not conservative enough." With President Barack Obama seemingly more eager to veto GOP-passed bills than to compromise with Republicans, he said, "I don't think it's possible to do very large things until after the next election."  Chabot's colleagues cite other reasons why House Republican leaders — headed by Speaker John Boehner of Ohio — are suffering embarrassing setbacks despite their 245-188 seat advantage over Democrats. (Two Republican-held seats are vacant.)  GOP leaders struggle to find even a few Democratic votes when needed because moderates from both parties have largely been driven out of Congress. And congressional leaders no longer can dole out pork-barrel projects, or earmarks. For decades, their predecessors used such favors to move balky lawmakers from "nay" to "aye."  "It's a contentious time, with a lot of polarization," said Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma. "And you have fewer tools."  "There's no earmarks," Cole said, and current leaders rarely turn to bare-knuckle tactics such as kicking uncooperative colleagues off plum committees. "Boehner's style is a little bit more easy-going," he said. "He doesn't like to punish people."  "A lot of people think it's about intimidation," Cole said. Actually, he said, "it's persuasion most of the time, or it's appealing to your being on the team."  Many Democrats, and some Republicans, have little sympathy for Boehner.  GOP Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, a frequent Boehner critic, taunted the speaker for recently working with the House's top Democrat to seek a long-term solution to Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors. When reporters asked Huelskamp on Thursday about Boehner's fallback plan to tackle the latest budget quarrel in the Rules Committee, the Kansan asked sarcastically: "Did Nancy Pelosi approve that one? Oh, no, that's the doc fix."  Wednesday's midnight meltdown in the House Budget Committee embarrassed Boehner's team because two top lieutenants intervened — unsuccessfully, it turned out — against Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price's advice.  Price, from Georgia, had warned that tea party-aligned Republicans wouldn't swallow the leadership's bid to increase military spending without clearly offsetting the cost elsewhere. When Price was proven correct, Boehner's team agreed Thursday to hand the sticky issue to the Rules Committee, and eventually to the full House.  Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas pointed a friendly finger toward Huelskamp and told reporters: "We are working with members to listen to them about what they want and what they're going to support."  "The Rules Committee is going to make a great decision," Sessions said. "I just don't know what that is yet."  Several Republicans predicted Boehner's team will escape the budget jam next week. Even the balkiest GOP lawmakers want the House and Senate to agree on a budget plan so they can use a process called "reconciliation" as a possible vehicle for long-sought goals such as repealing the president's health care law.  "That's the No. 1 issue to me," Huelskamp said, even though Republicans acknowledge that Obama would veto it.  Boehner said his caucus will somehow bring together lawmakers who demand more military spending and those who insist on deeper spending cuts.  The cost-cutters prevailed in the Budget Committee this week. "But there is overwhelming support in our conference for providing additional resources to protect our national security," Boehner told reporters. He said he will "continue to work with all of our members on this issue."

The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act would force lawmakers to approve or deny every major rule with an economic impact of $100 million or more. The executive branch finalized 200 such rules last year, when it produced 16 times more regulations overall than the laws Congress passed over the same time period.  Right-leaning policy group American Action Forum published a study Tuesday predicting how much each state could save if the regulatory reform bill was already law, and could be used to block the 12 most expensive proposed federal rules from passing into regulation.  Sam Batkins, the nonprofit's director of regulatory policy and author of the research, said he envisioned the measure giving Congress the power to kill proposed rules similar to the ones he used in his research if it ever became law. He said the bill would allow lawmakers to "claw back" some of the governing power federal agencies presently hold.

The White House says Maria Echaveste cites a prolonged confirmation process as well as her family's best interests.  Obama nominated Echaveste last September. She had yet to receive a confirmation hearing in the Senate.  A graduate of Stanford University and Berkeley Law School, Echaveste was deputy chief of staff and a presidential assistant during the Clinton administration. When Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state, she appointed Echaveste a special representative to Bolivia.  Echaveste is a partner in the consulting firm Nueva Vista Group in San Francisco. A native of Texas who grew up in California, Echaveste would have been the first American woman to be ambassador to Mexico.  Her withdrawal was first reported by Politico.

Government officials and private insurers are making one final effort to encourage people to sign up and help them navigate state and federal exchanges to avoid paying fees as a result of being uninsured. Ahead of this looming deadline, sign-up rates have surged in the past week, and even Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) quipped during a press briefing on Thursday, as a reminder to sign up for health insurance, that for Valentine’s Day, “you can take your loved one to sign up for the Affordable Care Act.”  Jokes aside, Obamacare is a complex system with a lot of moving parts that raise a justifiably high number of questions about how it works, what different terms mean and how people will be affected. Even if you already have health insurance, below are a few basic answers key to know before Sunday’s deadline:  What is open enrollment? For the year 2015, the open enrollment period started Nov. 15, 2014 and ends in two days, on Feb. 15, 2015. The open enrollment period allows people to use state or federal health exchanges to sign up for a new health insurance plan, switch to a different one or apply for subsidies from the government to offset the cost of insurance. It’s the only time you can purchase a major medical plan in order to qualify for minimum essential coverage in the individual and family market, unless you qualify for a special enrollment period. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) have open enrollment all year.  What is a health exchange? A health exchange is another word for a health insurance marketplace, a website that allows people to shop for and compare health insurance plans, and choose one to purchase. If people qualify based on their income level, plans bought through these exchanges can be subsidized by the government in the form of tax credits. The exchanges were set up under the Affordable Care Act, and some states run their own marketplaces, but the majority (36 states) opted to let the federal government do it for them via HealthCare.gov.  What is a special enrollment period? A special enrollment period is held outside the open enrollment period and allows people to obtain coverage if they go through certain qualifying life events, such as getting married or having a child, which give them have 60 days to enroll. If you lose your health care coverage, you can get a special enrollment period totaling 120 days to sign up for health insurance via the marketplace.  What happens to those who miss the Feb. 15 deadline for signing up for health care coverage? People who miss the Feb. 15 deadline can buy private coverage outside of the marketplace. These private plans tend to be short-term, and they don’t prevent people from having to pay penalties for not having health insurance. Also, subsidies from the government for health insurance can only be obtained for plans bought through the exchange – not private plans. The next open enrollment period will not begin until October 2015, so anyone who wants to buy health insurance via the exchange but misses the February deadline will have to wait until then.  What happens to those who do not have health insurance at all? Those who don’t have minimum essential coverage will have to pay a fee when they file their federal income taxes. Minimum essential coverage includes health care plans bought on federal or state exchanges, job-based insurance, or Medicare/Medicaid, CHIP and other government plans. Certain programs that help cover medical fees don’t count, like workers’ compensation or coverage solely for vision or dental care.  How high are the penalties for not being insured? Penalties depend on the year and the length of time a person has been uninsured. Those who don’t have insurance and don’t qualify for exemptions will have to calculate how much they owe using one of those dreaded government tax worksheets. For 2014 returns, penalties are 1 percent of one’s income or $95 per adult and up to $285 for a family, whichever is higher. Rates will rise sharply every subsequent year.

Fallon, currently the top spokesman for the Justice Department, told his staff Tuesday morning that he will leave at the end of the month.  Fallon's name has been circulating for weeks as a likely addition to the Clinton team, and two senior Democrats familiar with the campaign plan said Tuesday that he will hold the top spokesman's job.  Fallon is expected to begin work at the campaign in April. Clinton is expected to announce an exploratory committee early that month, followed by a formal start to daily campaigning later in the spring.  Fallon was formerly the top spokesman for Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and was considered one of the most skilled Democratic communicators on Capitol Hill.  Generally well-regarded by reporters, Fallon joins an emerging Clinton press team known for good relations with the press. That stands in contrast to the sometimes toxic relations that developed between the 2008 Clinton campaign and reporters covering her.  Longtime Democratic strategist Jennifer Palmieri is leaving her post as White House communications director to hold the same title for Clinton. Her last day at the White House is March 20.  Former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee communications director Jesse Ferguson will handle day-to-day press duties at the campaign headquarters in New York, the Democratic sources said. Both requested anonymity because Clinton has not yet announced her campaign or formally hired staff.  Ferguson has been traveling between Washington and New York to hire junior press team members, including for regional press desks and deployment to Iowa and New Hampshire.  Also in the Clinton press lineup will be Josh Schwerin, who was spokesman for the DCCC during the 2014 midterm elections. Current Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill is expected to remain in a prominent role. All bring established relationships with reporters.

In every case, the bank in question was listed as a sponsor of the event even after the investigations were widely reported in the media.  The Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative are, ostensibly, both attractive organizations to provide a foundation for the Clintons to build their legacy, and for Hillary Clinton to make a presidential campaign pitch.  CGI aims to foster partnerships between governments, foundations, companies and other stakeholders to improve the lives of people worldwide. Its Annual Meeting is a routinely glitzy confab, bringing together business and world leaders, celebrities and government officials to discuss policy proposals and global issues over three days every September.  Each year the event partners with two dozen or so major corporate and foundation sponsors, a designation that entails a higher level of monetary and operational support for the conference than that given by regular GCI members  Of the array of sponsors, a few banks were perennial supporters, including British bank Standard Chartered, Goldman Sachs and Germany's Deutsche Bank, all of which were listed as mid-level backers of the event every year from 2009 on. French bank Credit Agricole was a supporter of the event from 2009-2012.  British banking giant Barclays emerged as a "strategic partner" with CGI for its 2010 annual meeting, and gave the same level of support every year after that. In 2014, HSBC became the latest bank to get on-board with the event, signing on as a "convening sponsor," the highest level of support possible.  All of the banks have had pockmarked pasts — and many were either under investigation or fined for breaking Iran sanctions, while Clinton was secretary of State.  In August of 2010, the Justice Department announced Barclays would pay nearly $300 million in fines for breaking sanctions against Iran, Cuba, Sudan and others. The next month, it was — for the first time — a "strategic partner" for that year's annual event.  In 2012, the CGI annual event featured three major banking partners that were also facing penalties and investigations for breaking Iran sanctions.  Standard Chartered paid a total $667 million, when all was said and done, to various regulators to settle allegations it violated Iran sanctions. The first half of that fine was levied by the New York State Department of Financial Services in August 2012, and the next month Standard Chartered appeared as a "meeting sponsor" of the CGI's annual meeting.  A late August 2012 New York Times report revealed Deutsche Bank was also under investigation for potential Iran sanctions violations. Days later, Reuters reported Credit Agricole was conducting an internal review of payments involving countries that may have been subject to U.S. sanctions, at the urging of the Manhattan District Attorney and other "American governmental authorities." Deutsche Bank was a meeting sponsor and Credit Agricole was a partner at that year's CGI meeting.  In December 2012, the Department of Justice and U.S. Treasury announced HSBC would pay $1.92 billion to settle allegations that the bank allowed drug cartels to launder billions of dollars and that the bank violated U.S. sanctions by illegally conducting transactions on behalf of customers in Iran, Libya, Cuba, Sudan and Burma.  It's unclear whether HSBC or any of its subsidiaries gave to the foundation that year or prior, but records on the Foundation's website that were recently updated indicate the bank contributed anywhere from $500,000 to $1,000,000 in 2014, when it was listed as a convening sponsor for that year's meeting, the highest level of support possible.  The fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the Foundation placed on its fundraising operation. Those questions have steadily grown over the past few weeks as a Wall Street Journal report uncovered close ties between the Foundation's contributors and Clinton's policy work during her time at State.  But Clinton Foundation officials declined to detail how it vets its contributors.  "With all sponsors or partners, we perform a vet that consists of thoroughly researching all publicly available information about the organization or individual to make an assessment on whether it would be appropriate or inappropriate to proceed, in order to ensure that they comport with the Foundation's mission and goals," a Clinton Foundation official wrote in an email.  "The details of each determination is not something we make public. To successfully fulfill its mission, CGI is careful to engage with credible and effective individuals and organizations who have the ability to positively impact people around the world."  There's no indication the Clintons had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation's efforts. In fact, during the time Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State, CGI was split from the broader Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton had no direct involvement in its day-to-day activities. Clinton herself stayed out of the foundation entirely during her time at State.  But the two were reincorporated after Clinton left State in 2013, and the support from scandal-linked banks continued through the most recent event, when HSBC became a major backer. And both Clintons spoke at nearly every one of the events in question.  The Foundation wouldn't detail who within the organization secures commitments from corporate and foundation partners, and didn't comment on whether the Clintons are involved in that effort.  According to Foundation officials, those partnerships are brokered by a team of account managers who "develop and maintain relationships with the NGOs, Foundations, companies and individuals who make Commitments to Action through CGI."  The event sponsorships, officials said, denote members of CGI that have contributed to the group's work through a higher level of monetary or in-kind support than the rest of its members, though they wouldn't disclose how much. According to a 2013 New York Times report, sponsorships for the event start at $250,000.  Such organizations are allowed a higher number of spots at the organization's Annual Meeting and other meetings year-round.  But officials insisted in an email that no matter how much sponsors contribute to CGI, "it's not a partnership in which the organization dictates or has control over our stage or programming."  "We of course welcome the advice and suggestions from all of our members, no matter their level," an official added.  Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said in a statement that much of the work of the organization "wouldn't be possible" without cooperation among multiple organizations and companies, and defended its members as "credible and effective."  "CGI is careful to engage with credible and effective organizations and the results speak for themselves," he said.  Minassian said that since CGI was founded, its members have launched nearly 3,200 commitments that have affected 430 million people in 180 countries. Commitments launched by financial institutions include efforts to "increase access to credit in the developing world, support entrepreneurship opportunities for women and girls, increase financial literacy and tangibly address global health challenges."  But some of those banks were also implicated in various financial plots that impacted the global economy and earned them steep fines.  According to a Justice Department statement issued in June 2012, Barclays "admitted and accepted responsibility for its misconduct" at the center of a scheme to manipulate global interest rates, which in turn affected prices for consumer lending.  The bank agreed to pay $450 million in total to the Justice Department, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the UK's Financial Services Authority to resolve the violations.  The following month, the Financial Times reported that regulators were investigating Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Credit Agricole for potential involvement in that scandal. All four acknowledged that investigations related to the developments were underway, but most declined to comment on the substance of the report; Credit Agricole said in a statement that the bank "has not been accused of any wrongdoing."  Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole and Barclays were sponsors of varying levels at that year's CGI annual meeting, just two months after the FT report was published.  In July 2014, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused both Barclays and Deutsche Bank of helping hedge funds avoid paying more than $6 billion in taxes. Two months later, Barclays was listed as a "strategic partner," while Deutsche Bank was a "meeting sponsor," at the annual CGI meeting.s  In August 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced Goldman Sachs agreed to a settlement worth $1.2 billion to resolve claims it sold high-risk mortgage-backed securities, one of the abuses by big banks that contributed to the economic meltdown just six years before. On Sept. 12, 2014, just three weeks prior to that year's CGI meeting, the FHFA announced HSBC would pay $550 million to settle similar claims. Goldman Sachs was again a meeting partner; HSBC became a CGI backer for the first time at that year's event, as a "convening sponsor," the highest level of support possible.  Barclays and Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the ties to the Clinton Foundation, and three of the four remaining banks did not respond to a request for comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesman stressed that it was not the subject of a criminal investigation but rather a civil lawsuit, and noted that most of the world's biggest corporations, which are frequently major drivers of international charitable work, have faced lawsuits and investigations at times.  Contributions from banks are nothing new for the Clintons, or their foundation. The financial sector was the second-biggest contributor to Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, and according to the Washington Post, donations from the financial services sector made up the largest share of corporate donors to the Clinton Foundation.  But that closeness to Wall Street has many progressives eying her warily, and the connection to banks facing investigations or fines could add fuel to that fire. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said it increases pressure on Clinton to deliver with her deeds as much as her words.  "It's fair for voters to be skeptical of Hillary Clinton's speeches about holding Wall Street accountable when Wall Street institutions fund her foundation at the same time she gives those speeches," he said.  "That's a burden that Clinton will have to address by backing up her words with bold action -- like appointing an economic team not beholden to Wall Street and showing a willingness to break up too-big-to-fail banks and jail bankers who broke the law."  If nothing else, it underscores the challenge she'll face during a presidential campaign in making a populist economic pitch to average voters and framing herself as a reformer while at the center of a tangled web of ties to troubled banks.  Michael Smallberg, an investigator at the good-government group the Project on Government Oversight, said that the reports on the Foundation's financial backers could "complicate" Clinton's message in 2016.  "The recent close ties between the foundation and Wall Street banks and other big businesses may complicate her attempt to portray herself as an economic populist and reposition her stance on financial issues," he said.  In response to the recent Wall Street Journal report outlining Clinton's corporate lobbying abroad as secretary of State, Robert Harrison, CGI's CEO, outlined in a blog post the ways some of the companies and foundations named have contributed to improving conditions for people across the world.  "This is the story the Wall Street Journal missed -- the positive impact that members of CGI are having on millions of people worldwide and the evolution of the conventional philanthropic model over the past decade to a dynamic ecosystem that now promotes creative collaboration across antiquated divides," Harrison wrote.  And Clinton Foundation officials defended the contributions from the banks, which it says represent less than one percent of CGI's total membership, but are "also some of the organizations with the capacity to make the biggest impact."  Those officials noted that many organizations with checkered pasts have contributed to the greater good.  "Many major institutions -- financial, media, industrial or otherwise -- have been subject to investigation at some point, and that alone shouldn't preclude these organizations, which are capable of significant and positive impact, from contributing to improving lives," an official wrote.  Indeed, CNN has partnered with CGI for its Annual Meeting, and the network's parent company, Time Warner, was fined $300 million by the SEC in 2005 for fraud and aiding and abetting other securities frauds. And companies and banks under investigation have advertised with CNN, including HSBC, which recently advertised on CNNMoney's homepage.

KMOV-TV  JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Missouri's auditor, who fatally shot himself in an apparent suicide, had vowed to take down the state's most powerful politicians and donors, including his fellow Republicans, when he launched an anti-corruption campaign for governor last month.  But in his final days, Tom Schweich described having knots in his stomach over what he thought was an anti-Semitic whisper campaign by a GOP consultant who now runs the state party.  His intensity had served him well in the past -- he was proud of exposing corruption in his four years as auditor. But his tendency to fixate on issues also sometimes made it hard for him to get over political attacks, say some of his advisers and colleagues.  Schweich left behind a wife and two children -- and a seemingly rising political career -- when he died Thursday at age 54.  He said his audits exposed more than 30 "corrupt government officials" who allegedly stole taxpayer money. But his promised gubernatorial campaign against corruption had barely begun.  Announcing his candidacy last month, Schweich had vowed to bring a never-before-seen "level of intensity, tenacity, transparency, and rigor" in a quest to root out "rampant corruption in Jefferson City."  As evidence of his grit, Schweich touted his work in the U.S. State Department coordinating an anti-drug initiative in Afghanistan.  "Negotiating with Afghan warlords prepared me well for Missouri politics," he said.  He took specific aim at the state's top political donor, retired investment mogul Rex Sinquefield, who largely bankrolled the campaign of his GOP gubernatorial rival Catherine Hanaway, a former state House speaker and federal prosecutor.  Schweich said the $900,000 Hanaway accepted from her "billionaire patron" made her "bought and paid for" by Sinquefield, who employs an "army of mercenaries" to exert his influence over elected officials.  "Nothing is too dishonest for them, and apparently nothing is too petty for them, either," Schweich said last month. "It's corrupt, and there's a lot more corruption going on in that camp that we'll be talking about in the days to come."  Hanaway generally deflected Schweich's accusations, and Sinquefield has defended his political endeavors.  "Undoubtedly, rooting out corruption is a very good thing," Hanaway told reporters and editors at the Capitol in mid-February. "But I have a question: Isn't that his job now?"  In the ensuing days, Schweich became increasingly focused on another man: John Hancock, a consultant who did opposition research for Hanaway last year and was elected Feb. 21 as chairman of the Missouri Republican Party.  Schweich, an Episcopalian, told The Associated Press he believed Hancock had been telling Republican donors and activists that Schweich was Jewish, which he perceived as an anti-Semitic statement.  Schweich told the AP that he has some Jewish ancestry, but said he had become increasingly firm in his Christian faith.  Hancock told the AP after Schweich's death that it's possible he may have told some people Schweich was Jewish, "but I wouldn't have said it in a derogatory or demeaning fashion," he said.  Schweich confronted Hancock in November about the alleged comments, but their tension was not resolved. As the date approached for the party chairman's election, Schweich reached out to other Republicans -- including U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and some state party committee members -- to try to rally people against electing Hancock.  Some Republicans declined to get involved in what they viewed as personal spat.  Eventually, Hancock's alleged comments "became some kind of a hurdle" to Schweich, said state Republican Party Secretary Pat Thomas, who was among those to whom Schweich had appealed.  On Monday, Schweich outlined the whole ordeal to an AP reporter, saying he planned to hold a press conference about it the next day -- even though his advisers said it was a poor political move. Schweich described having knots in his stomach for the past week, because he was so worked up over it. He didn't follow through on the press conference, telling the AP he was still trying to get a prominent Jewish person to stand with him first.  Then, on Thursday morning, Schweich talked twice over the phone with the AP to invite a reporter to his suburban St. Louis home for an afternoon interview, saying he was ready to go public with his accusations. He said he was also inviting a reporter from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  Police say authorities received an emergency call about the shooting just minutes after those phone calls.  Hancock emailed state Republican Party officials Friday saying he was "sad to have learned that some of (Schweich's) final moments were spent thinking of an ongoing disagreement with me."  Hancock said he had "mistakenly believed that Tom Schweich was Jewish," and that Schweich "had mistakenly believed that I had attacked his religion."  "We may never know what drove Tom to take his own life -- but it seems clear that there were deeper and more profound issues than a minor political squabble," Hancock said.  A memorial service is scheduled for Tuesday at the Episcopal church Schweich attended.  On Friday, Gov. Jay Nixon appointed one of his own longtime aides, John Watson, to serve as auditor until Nixon chooses a permanent replacement. 
id=116038, title=GOP congressmen warn D.C. mayor on pot legalization, url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-congressmen-warn-d-c-mayor-pot-legalization/, datepublished=2015-02-25 21:37:16, date=2015-02-25 17:17:30.852000, datesaved=2015-02-25 17:17:30.852000, text=Alan Amsterdam (L), and Cesar Maxit, (C), volunteers with the DC Cannabis Campaign, talk to a voter about the ballot initiative to legalize marijuana in front of a polling location in the Adams Morgan neighborhood on November 4, 2014 in NW Washington D.C. Allison Shelley, Getty Images  Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Tuesday that Initiative 71, a marijuana legalization measure passed by 70 percent of the District's voters last November, will take effect on Thursday.  But on Tuesday night, a powerful duo of House Republicans delivered a dramatic warning to Bowser: If the city moves forward with legalizing pot, they promised, there will be hell to pay.  "Your assertion that Initiative 71 takes effect on Thursday is contrary to law," wrote Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, in a letter sent to Bowser. "We strongly suggest you reconsider your position."  "If you decide to move forward tomorrow with the legalization of marijuana in the District, you will be doing so in knowing and willful violation of the law," they added.  The lawmakers said the House Oversight Committee, which Chaffetz chairs, is investigating Bowser's push to move forward with legalization.  The initiative, if it takes effect Thursday, will legalize up to two ounces of marijuana for private, personal use among adults. Selling or buying pot would remain illegal, as would smoking in public spaces. The possession of marijuana -- for recreational, medical or any other use -- remains illegal under federal law.  D.C. residents could cultivate up to six plants in their home at once, with only three plants matured at any given time. For households with multiple adults, those limits are 12 and six plants respectively. City officials are promoting the motto "home use, home grown" to underscore the restrictions.  After the measure passed by a wide margin on Election Day, city officials said they would begin drawing up regulations to govern the sale and use of marijuana in the District, potentially clearing the way for the kind of dispensary model seen in states like Colorado and Washington that have already legalized pot.  But in December, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, hit the brakes, inserting language into a government funding bill that barred the District from using any federally appropriated money "to enact any law, rule, or regulation to legalize" pot for recreational use. The bill cleared both chambers of Congress during the lame duck session and was signed by President Obama.  As far as Chaffetz and Meadows were concerned, that closed the case. "Given Congress's broad powers to legislate with regard to the District of Columbia, it would be unprecedented for the District to take actions proscribed by legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President," they wrote to Bowser.  D.C. officials, including Bowser and Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives, have argued that the restrictions Congress passed do not apply to Initiative 71, because the measure was passed by D.C. voters more than a month before Congress took action to prevent legalization.  But the GOP lawmakers argued that any initiative passed by D.C. voters is not considered "enacted" until after a 30- or 60-day congressional review period. In this case, they said, that period elapsed after Congress passed the bill prohibiting pot legalization.  Chaffetz and Meadows asked Bowser to provide the names of any D.C. government employee "who participated in any way in any action related to the enactment of Initiative 71." They also requested an accounting of the money spent on the process, and any related documents or communications.  In an interview with the Washington Post, Chaffetz minced no words in describing how seriously he's taking the matter.  "There are very severe consequences for violating this provision," he said. "You can go to prison for this. We're not playing a little game here."

John Kitzhaber.(AP Photo/Don Ryan) | ASSOCIATED PRESS  SALEM, Ore., Feb 18 (Reuters) - Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown was sworn in as governor on Wednesday, taking over from a fellow Democrat who saw his decades-long political career crumble because of an influence-peddling scandal involving his fiancée.  Governor John Kitzhaber had said he would resign effective Wednesday morning after federal and state corruption probes stemming from allegations that his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, used her role in his office for personal gain.  Brown was sworn in during a ceremony on the floor of the state House of Representatives in Salem, Oregon's capital, becoming the country's first openly bisexual governor.  Elected to an unprecedented fourth term in November, Kitzhaber has denied any wrongdoing but agreed to step down following criticism from prominent fellow Democrats. His resignation triggers an election for governor to be held next year in the West Coast state.  Brown, who has touted her work in passing comprehensive civil rights and domestic partnership laws, has said little about her plans. But her office said she would urge a bipartisan approach and "lay out a series of immediate reforms needed to restore the public's trust in government."

id=125631, title=Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential ambitions 'reflected' in recent decisions, url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/02/marco-rubio-2016-presidential-run-speculation-cpac, datepublished=2015-03-02 14:57:38, date=2015-03-02 15:13:30.274000, datesaved=2015-03-02 15:13:30.274000, text=Marco Rubio isn’t quite ready to say he is running for president, yet admits it sure does look like he will seek the White House in 2016.  “I think that’s reflected in both our travel and some of the staffing decisions that we’ve made,” the Florida senator said. “We – if in fact I make that final decision on a run – want those elements to be in place.”  The message that his decision is still pending is one Rubio delivered again this past week on stage, both at the Conservative Public Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington and at the conservative Club for Growth in Palm Beach. But allies of the first-term senator and former speaker of the Florida House who have spoken with him about his plans fully expect that he will run for president, rather than a second Senate term.  “I assume he’s running,” said Wayne Berman, a veteran Republican fundraiser who was chairman of Senator John McCain’s presidential fundraising in 2008. “He will help the party turn the page, politically, to the next generation.”  Nearly a dozen people close to Rubio, including GOP officials, fundraisers and his advisers, say Rubio has told them he is in the final stages of planning the launch of his presidential run and will formally join the crowded field of Republican hopefuls as early as April. All spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with Rubio.  Berman said he is working to line up donors to finance that national campaign. Among the donors who have signed on: former representative Bill Paxon, now with law firm Aiken Gump’s Washington offices; Dallas investor George Seay and Goldman Sachs’ Joe Wall. Their goal is to raise $50m before next year’s Iowa caucuses, according to four donors who have spoken to Rubio about the likely campaign’s budget.  “Marco’s best asset is Marco,” said Scott Weaver, a former Capitol Hill staffer who organised a recent dinner for potential Rubio donors. “If you can get Marco in front of people, he sells himself. It’s been an easier sales process than we thought at this point.”  Rubio’s team is also aggressively courting Spencer Zwick, Mitt Romney’s top fundraiser in the 2012 presidential race. Zwick is sought after by several prospective Republican candidates and has also spoken favourably about Rubio’s chief rival, former Florida governor Jeb Bush.  Bush was a mentor to Rubio during their time in Florida. The two are likely to compete for many of the same donors, both in Florida and nationwide, and Rubio acknowledges it would be “a bit unusual” to run against Bush.  “I think he’s proving he’s going to be a very formidable candidate,” Rubio said. “I just believe if you think the best place to serve your country is to run for and hopefully win the presidency, you move forward on that irrespective of who else is in the race. If I ran, it wouldn’t be against him.”  No major candidates for president have declared their intentions; even Bush says his decision on that is ahead. Formally entering the race triggers a host of legal and campaign finance complications. But a decision to commit is different for Rubio, whose Senate term runs through 2016. He has said repeatedly he will not run for Senate re-election and the presidential nomination at the same time.  That’s a different approach than likely presidential rival Rand Paul. The Kentucky senator is trying to set up a two-step system in his state that would allow him to seek the presidential nomination through a caucus and a Senate bid through a primary. Kentucky law prohibits one person from seeking two positions in the same nominating process.  Rubio’s advisers have told party leaders they should expect to recruit a candidate to run for his Senate seat in 2016, according to four people involved in the talks, who discussed the private conversation on the condition of anonymity because Rubio has not notified the National Republican Senatorial Committee of his plans.  At the same time, Rubio’s team is preparing for a national campaign. His top political adviser and likely campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, has been recruiting operatives – including Jim Merrill, who ran Romney’s New Hampshire campaigns and was at Rubio’s side for a two-day visit to the state last week. Spokesman Alex Conant is leaving Rubio’s Senate office this week to begin work at his political action committee.  “When you consider doing something like that, you can’t just decide to do it and then start working,” Rubio said. “You have to have conditions in place to move forward. Some of them are very similar to the ones we’d have to take anyway if we ran for Senate. Others are different.”

But there will be some shouting.  Nothing proved that more this week than when same-sex marriage arrived in Alabama, which ultimately led to an epic and at times rambling 20-minute-plus conversation Thursday between Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore and CNN's Chris Cuomo. It was repetitive, in the weeds, and in some ways futile, foreshadowing the type of framing at least some prominent conservatives will maintain as they keep up the fight against same-sex marriage.  Moore dubbed the whole thing a "federal intrusion in state sovereignty."  "No judge of the United States or federal district court has the right to invent the definition of marriage, which is not even contained in the United States Constitution," he said. "And that's the problem, we have people going in trying to mandate to the state of Alabama that the sanctity of marriage amendment in our constitution is wrong, and that's simply not right to do."  There were also references to slavery and segregation, recalling the South's last stands over "state's rights." Moore has become the poster boy for this issue among social conservatives, and while many national Republicans have retreated on the issue, he does have some company.  Likely presidential candidates Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and former Arkansas governor/Fox host Mike Huckabee (R) will appear in a documentary called the "Light Wins: How to Overcome the Criminalization of Christianity," which portends that "darkness" is being ushered into the land with increasing acceptance of same-sex marriage.  First reported by the liberal outlet Right Wing Watch, the documentary comes out at the end of the month. Expect it to be a hit in evangelical churches, the very audience that Huckabee and Paul want to reach as they consider 2016 bids (think: Iowa).  "What kind of freedom of speech do we have if a person who expresses a biblical viewpoint about marriage is told they can't open their businesses in a location?" Huckabee asks in the trailer.  Moore's comments and reports on the new documentary come as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in an interview with Bloomberg, went so far as to speculate about what the country's reaction would be if the Supreme Court finds that there is a Constitutional right to gay marriage (as many expect it to do).  “The change in people’s attitudes on that issue has been enormous,” Ginsburg said. “In recent years, people have said, ‘This is the way I am.’ And others looked around, and we discovered it’s our next-door neighbor -- we’re very fond of them. Or it’s our child’s best friend, or even our child. I think that as more and more people came out and said that ‘this is who I am,’ the rest of us recognized that they are one of us.”  But the Christian-conservative objections will remain, even if their platform is mostly cable news, conservative radio, churches and a handful of presidential hopefuls. Moore will continue to be the gold standard of resistance, with other GOPers forced to say whether they are with him or against him.  It's not exactly what the GOP wants in the run-up to the 2016 campaign, but it was probably unavoidable.

White House officials responded by saying the attack last year was made public and that no classified information was compromised. And they declined to comment on CNN's assertion that Russia was the culprit.  “This report is not referring to a new incident,” National Security Council spokesman Mark Stroh told Fox News.  Stroh said the report by CNN was “speculating” on the attempts last year to hack an unclassified network for the Executive Office of the President.  However, he also made clear the administration takes such threats “very seriously” and that “immediate” efforts were taken to evaluate and mitigate the hacking.  He declined to respond to the assertion that Russia was the perpetrator of the White House attack by saying: “As has been our position, we are not going to comment on the referenced article’s attribution to specific actors.”  Ben Rhodes, the president’s deputy national security adviser for strategic communication, said on CNN that White House officials do not believe their classified systems were compromised last year and that they are “constantly” updating security measures.  However, he said any information -- even email and unclassified material -- is viewed as “sensitive” and that officials have since been told to do classified work on the classified system.  Rhodes also declined to say whether Russia was involved, arguing that Iran and other countries engage in such cyber activities.  However, he acknowledged that Moscow is “certainly active in cyber space and they’re active in the espionage space. So we’re always taking precautions against cyber danger.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Smoothing the way for a succession of party power in the U.S. Senate, its No. 4 Democrat, Patty Murray, has endorsed New York Senator Chuck Schumer to be the chamber's next Democratic leader after the 2016 elections, replacing Harry Reid, a Murray aide said on Monday.  The endorsement means Washington state's Murray, 64, is joining what Schumer calls a majority of Senate Democrats backing him. Reid, 75, announced his retirement on Friday.  "Senator Murray spoke to Senator Schumer several times over the past few days and told him that she planned to support him for leader," the Murray aide said.  Murray, considered a progressive, is the secretary for the Senate Democratic caucus. She has led important negotiations for Democrats on the budget with Republicans.  Her decision to back Schumer follows an endorsement of him last week by No. 2 Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois.  Reid, too, has thrown his weight behind Schumer. Reid will stay in his post for another 22 months. His announcement Friday positioned Schumer, a Wall Street ally, as heir apparent, with Democrats seeking to regain control of the Senate next year.  Schumer, 64, was elected to the Senate in 1998. As head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, he worked to increase the number of Democrats in the Senate.  Murray, a former Senate Budget Committee chairwoman, negotiated a landmark budget deal with Republican Representative Paul Ryan in the wake of a 16-day government shutdown in 2013. The deal eased "sequester" spending cuts and set the stage for two years of relative fiscal peace, a period due to end this autumn.

Together, they have blocked needed initiatives through a network of Capitol lobbyists, political action committees, think tanks and libertarian advocacy organizations with a national reach.  In Sacramento, the fate of legislation that could most benefit the great majority of Californians is often sealed behind closed doors by corporate and trade lobbying long before a bill can ever see a floor vote. Numbers released this month by California’s Secretary of State showed that, in 2014, top lobbyists representing big oil and gas, the health care industry, utilities, manufacturing and business interests, together outspent organized labor nearly four-to-one ($28.4 million to $7.7 million).  For their $28.4 million, state policy powerbrokers were able, among other things, to block attempts to aid education and increase the average Californians’ quality of life. Their target list is revealing, beginning with a proposed law that would have brought California in line with other petroleum-rich states’ tax policies.  California is the only top-ten oil-producing state without a so-called severance tax and, last year, legislators proposed Senate Bill 1017, which would have instituted a well-head tax on oil and natural gas. The revenue would have been used to roll back tuitions for the state’s public universities and community colleges — once more putting them within reach of students from middle-income families. The other half of the estimated $2 billion in annual revenues would have been divided equally between health and human services programs, and state parks.  But passage of SB 1017 was not to be, in part because of the efforts of the California Chamber of Commerce. This perennial powerhouse of corporate influence is known for its yearly “job killer” legislation hit list and has proved one of the most effective forces in perpetuating economic inequality.  In 2014 alone, CalChamber managed to:  An important ally of CalChamber is the powerful Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and its effective president Catherine Reheis-Boyd. Although it spends much of its Capitol firepower shooting down proposed fracking moratoriums, the association shared a huge role, with CalChamber, in killing SB 1017, the bill to impose an oil severance tax. WSPA financed a constellation of business allies and faux-grassroots organizations that included single-issue “AstroTurf” groups like the Californians Against Higher Oil Taxes.  When it comes to putting profits ahead of the health of Californians, CalChamber sometimes teams up with another ally, the California Hospital Association (CHA), whose health care industry lobbyists are major players in Sacramento. In 2014, CalChamber took the lead on defeating AB 2533, a bill designed to allow patients to get urgent care from an out-of-network provider at the same price it would cost them to use an in-network provider.  But it was CHA that spearheaded — and prevailed for the second year running — in killing AB 503, a law that would have given Californians an exact accounting of the hundreds of millions of dollars that nonprofit hospitals are currently writing off as charity care to fulfill their charitable tax exempt status. CHA also successfully brought down SB 1269. That bill would have set hospital service standards in the post-Obamacare landscape, in which some hospitals have been placing acute care patients in lower-standard outpatient observation beds in order to cut costs on Medicare beneficiaries.  Perhaps the most prominent individuals with a proxy at California’s powerbroker table are the out-of-state brothers who have become synonymous with national income inequality. Together, Charles and David Koch have a net worth of around $100 billion (or about $313.58 million for every U.S. man, woman and child), and the pair has made no secret of their willingness to use their bottomless pockets to clear the decks of those opposed to transforming America into a laissez faire corporate Utopia. Just last month, a Koch-funded donor network revealed its intention to spend much of a $889 million fund to tilt races in California and elsewhere during the 2016 election cycle.  A 2012 analysis of the donor network’s Byzantine but highly effective money laundering operations revealed an array of limited-liability companies that dissolved and reappeared under different names, and that swapped funds back and forth. The report stated this system was designed to darken the sources of its cash and allow the network to maintain the appearance of “social welfare” spending as stipulated under its 501(c)(4) nonprofit status.  Some of that money came under the harsh light of California’s Attorney General in 2013, when Kamala Harris slapped two Koch front groups, the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership, with a record $1 million fine for violating state election law.  A major clearinghouse for inequality-aimed political money — and a longtime conduit in the national Koch donor network — is Donors Trust (DT), which since 1999 has funneled more than $400 million to a number of far-right think tanks, foundations and advocacy groups. Dubbed “the dark money ATM of the conservative movement,” DT (and its sister trust, Donors Capital Fund), is a “donor advised fund” that offers its wealthy libertarian patrons both anonymity and guarantees of ideological purity by funding assaults on labor unions, climate scientists, public schools and economic regulations of all stripes.  The trust’s California interests are watched over by DT director William “Jerry” Hume, CEO of Walnut Creek-based vegetable processing giant Basic American Foods. The little-known Hume, who also sits on the boards of the Heritage Foundation, the Hoover Institution and privatized-education promoters the Foundation for Educational Choice, has been a major donor to business-friendly Democrats in Sacramento as well as failed “paycheck protection” ballot measures.  One of Donor Trust’s more prolific clients is the vast, $83 million State Policy Network (SPN), which devotes itself to funding a broad spectrum of nominally nonpartisan studies designed to support and fine-tune model laws, created by the pro-corporation American Legislative Exchange Council, for adoption at the statehouse level.  In California, both DT and SPN support such like-minded think tanks as Orange County’s California Public Policy Center and the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute (PRI), which may be best known for the omnipresence of its Canadian-citizen president, Sally Pipes, on TV panels and at congressional hearings, inveighing against universal healthcare.  The Golden State, of course, is but one of many battlegrounds in the national inequality war, and that makes its fortunes inextricably linked to brewing battles elsewhere on such powerbroker-pushed initiatives as laws that preempt county and municipal living wage and paid sick leave laws, while allowing those same localities to pass right-to-work statutes in places like Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  The entire American public sector workforce may suffer the fate of workers in those states, depending on how the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a California case that could overturn an earlier high court decision that had extended to nonunion public sector employees the requirement to pay a fee to the labor organization that is legally required to represent them.  This potentially far-reaching suit, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, originated in Orange County and was brought by another Koch affiliate, the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Individual Rights. Last month, Friedrichs lead counsel Michael Carvin (who is also suing to eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance subsidies for about five million Americans) petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case. Should that happen, and the court’s anti-labor majority prevail, America could well find itself transformed into a right-to-work nation at the single stroke of a gavel.

Much of the speech invoked the bravery, dignity and historical rightness of Martin Luther King Jr., and his fellow movement activists.  All of which puts me in mind of the complex relationship between liberals and radicals.  History shows that liberals need radicals. We need radicals because drastic change against entrenched evil and concentrated power requires personal bravery to the point of obsession. It requires a radical sensibility to look beyond today's limits and imagine what seems sheer impossibility within the current social order. And sometimes it's necessary to break the law to redeem the Constitution.  No great social change in America has occurred without radicals, beginning with the struggle to end slavery. Causes that now seem mainstream began with radical, impolite and sometimes civil disobedient protest.  Martin Luther King, Jr. was the best sort of radical. His tactics broke what was then the law -- flawed, biased, oppressive law. But he was above all affirmative and idealistic. He kept in his mind the kind of society America needed to be, and could be. He appealed to the best in America, bore personal witness and shamed his racist oppressors. MLK braved violence and eventually his own assassination, yet his radicalism was always constructive.  Birth control began as a radical movement for which some women went to jail; and astonishingly, contraception is still considered radical in some circles today.  The demonstrations against the Vietnam War were at first the work of radical protestors. Only later did they become more mannered and mainstream.  Some women today may take for granted rights that never would have been achieved without the radicalism of early feminism and then second-wave feminism. Same with gay rights, same with disability rights. Sometimes, outrageous tactics are needed to barge into the chamber of civil debate.  Even supposedly mainstream principles such as pure food and drugs, or safe working conditions, began with radical protest. The fact that these principles are being relentlessly undermined by corporate elites suggests the need for continued vigilance and radical protest once again.  The labor movement has a long history of necessarily confrontational organizing. And radicals, famously, make the best organizers. Unions were largely illegal until the 1930s, so you could not organize one without breaking the law. (Today, it is corporations that break the law to resist unions).  But here's where the story gets complicated. Radicals also need liberals.  The sit-down strikes of the 1930s could be institutionalized as durable reform only after FDR enforced the right of workers to organize, using first the 1935 Wagner Act and more importantly the leverage of wartime defense contracts. Militancy in factories combined with a sympathetic national government, to secure real gains for working people.  The civil disobedience of Dr. King and his followers required a rendezvous with Lyndon Johnson's desire to be the president who redeemed the promise of Lincoln.  Johnson was far from a radical, but when he declared, "We shall overcome," he was putting the power and prestige of the presidency on the side of radicals who were breaking the law to affirm the Constitution. Johnson was well aware the he could not have passed civil rights legislation without King -- and King of course understood how much he needed Johnson.  Marxists describe the State as "the executive committee of the ruling class." When the top financial posts at the U.S. Treasury are handed off among various alumni of Goldman Sachs, the way a prostitute is passed around drunken sailors, it sure seems as if government is a subsidiary of Wall Street. But occasionally, as in the alliance between Roosevelt and labor radicals, or between MLK and LBJ, the government actually functions as ally of the working class and the broad middle class of ordinary citizens. That's why one can cling to the hopes of liberalism.  Which role the State plays depends on the balance of activism. As current politics reveal all too vividly, government's default setting in a capitalist economy is to serve the wealthy and the powerful. Liberals can write policy proposals to their hearts' content. But unless they are backed by radicalism on the ground, they are playing in a sandbox.  David Rolf, a key architect of Seattle's $15-an-hour minimum wage and one of the best of today's radical labor organizers, puts the problem with prescience and eloquence. In a recent speech, he offered an aphorism that should stay with us:   "Policy is frozen politics." (I actually googled it -- and as far as I can tell, the phrase is original to Rolf.)  Policy is frozen politics. If you look back on American history, there are moments when political action produces reform and lasting social legislation. Politics produces policy. The policy advances social justice. For a time, that policy endures, the "frozen" fruit of what was once living activism.  But as Rolf explained, continuing the metaphor, even when seemingly embodied securely in law, policy tends to melt over time in the absence of continuing political mobilization and vigilance.  That's why all the legacy laws of earlier brief eras of political mobilization are under attack today from legislatures and courts reflecting rightwing resurgence -- civil rights laws, Social Security, pensions, the right to form a union, wage protection, Medicare, progressive taxation, and so on.  It's because politics has become lopsided. Policy is frozen politics -- the legacy of an earlier era and earlier political struggles. But policy can always be reversed by elites. That's why it takes hot politics -- liquid politics, current politics, radical politics -- to defend and refresh policy.  Yet, the story gets still more complicated; for it's not only leftwing radicals who are able to use the tactics of confrontation.  In much of our own era, the right has discovered the power of disruption--anti-choice crusaders blocking the way to Planned Parenthood clinics; anti-Obama activists disrupting Congressional district meetings on the Affordable Care Act; rightwing radicals in police uniforms executing innocent black teenagers.  Sometimes the civil disobedience of the right isn't in the streets. It's financial engineers illegally destroying the dreams of homeowners; or corporate moguls illegally stealing workers' wages; or the Koch Brothers and the power of wealth stealing our democracy.  We don't want a repeat of the Nazi era, where radical leftwing and radical rightwing gangs fought in hand-to-hand combat. That's the opposite of a liberal society. But neither do we want to be played for fools.  As polite liberals in policy parlors seek ways to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, we need to make damned sure that we are not out-organized. That, as always, will require some radicals.  Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and a visiting professor at Brandeis University's Heller School.

id=79468, title=22 Veterans Commit Suicide Each Day, url=http://time.com/3694053/veteran-suicide/, datepublished=2015-02-06 18:47:06, date=2015-02-06 19:15:24.322000, datesaved=2015-02-06 19:15:24.322000, text=Marine Clay Hunt received a hero’s welcome when he returned home to Texas after serving as a sniper in Afghanistan and Iraq. Struggling with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, the Purple Heart-winner became a widely-recognized advocate for veterans. In 2011, two years after leaving the Marines, the 28-year-old became one of the 8,000 veterans who commit suicide every year.  Earlier this week, four years after Hunt’s suicide, the United States Senate unanimously passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, and President Barack Obama will likely sign it into law. Among other things, the new law would create a comprehensive outreach program to address veterans’ mental health and provide financial incentives to psychiatric doctors who work with veterans.  “While we are a little bittersweet, because it is too late for our son Clay, we are thankful knowing that this bill will save many lives,” said Clay Hunt’s mother, Susan Selke, in a statement.  The recently passed bill provides a good starting point to help an at-risk population, but it’s a small step forward in addressing a longtime problem that has only been growing in severity, experts say. Veteran suicide claims the lives of 22 veterans each day. At around 30 suicides per 100,000 veterans, the suicide rate is more than double the rate for the general population.  The reasons for the high suicide rates are not entirely clear, but researchers say that military life exposes soldiers to a series of risk factors that place them at a heightened suicide risk, even though someone in the military is usually healthier physically than someone in the general population.  “Going into the military isn’t going to increase your risk of suicide,” says Martha Bruce, professor of sociology in psychiatry at Cornell University. “It’s the experiences either during [service], or in the transition, or after.”  First and foremost, combat exposes soldiers to traumatic life and death situations, and depression and PTSD may result. Others soldiers return with brain injuries. All of these ailments have been linked to increased risk of suicide.  Read more: Killed in Action, Far From the Battlefield  Experts point out that even those who return from service mentally healthy and without injury issue face a tough life transition when they return home. Many cannot find immediate employment and struggle to adapt to the culture of civilian life more broadly. Only 72% of veterans of the last decade’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were employed in 2013, according to government statistics. Struggling to adjust, some turn to alcohol, which is another risk factor for suicide. One in four veterans exposed to heavy combat binge drinks at least once a week, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  Shaped by the what Bruce calls the “self-reliant culture” of the military, veterans may be reluctant to seek help even when they recognize that they have a problem. “Culture plays a big role when it comes to not necessarily who gets distressed, but what people do in response to that,” says Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “The culture in the military and, certainly with veterans, is a very stoic one traditionally.”  An Air Force anti-suicide program initiated more than a decade ago aimed to tackle the cultural issue by making service members feel comfortable reporting their conditions, Moutier says. And that’s a big part of what the recently passed Clay Hunt Act seeks to do. Peer support counselors will work with veterans in local communities to make addressing mental health issue feel more culturally acceptable.  “You have to go to where people are, both in physical location as well as in their mindset,” Moutier says.  Suicide researchers say the bill is a step in the right direction, but they also acknowledge that the complexity of the issue makes it difficult to know what the legislation’s long-term effect will be.  “There isn’t a panacea that’s going to reverse the trend,” says Mark Kaplan, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Suicide is one of the most complex public health problems out there.”

The former CBS News correspondent, whose detractors say has inflated his own combat credentials while discussing his work covering the Falklands War 38 years ago, describes the matter as settled with newfound calm in an excerpt of the appearance posted on the show’s website.  “We had a controversy there and we put forth what my side was,” O’Reilly told Letterman. “They put forth what their side was. Folks decided. And, you know, it worked out okay for me. I got even more viewers.”  Yet the prickly political observer took a much different tone last month when Mother Jones magazine questioned whether he had actually witnessed fighting in the 1982 conflict between Argentina and Great Britain firsthand, as the talk show host contended in a 2011 book.  O’Reilly called the report “Bull---t” and referred to one of the reporters who wrote the story as a “smear merchant” in an interview with the Daily News at the time.  When The New York Times covered the controversy surrounding O'Reilly, he said on his show, “I am coming after you with everything I have. You can take it as a threat.”  And after a fellow CBS correspondent also said O’Reilly had not been in the line of fire, the fiery talk show host called his former colleague a “coward.”  But he had a much different take on Tuesday night. The conservative commentator’s “O’Reilly Factor” show’s ratings rose 20 percent in spite of the criticism, he says in the clip.  “Our ratings are now as high as they’ve ever been,” O’Reilly said. “So I think people do trust me, and I’m glad they do.”  He also called for NBC News to bring back Williams, who Letterman referred to as his friend. The late night host countered that the Williams episode bore some similarity to O’Reilly’s dispute.  “It’s down to the same thing,” Letterman says in the clip. “While yours is an editorial position and his is the neutral conveying of the news, trust is the residue of both positions. So people must trust you to the same degree.”  The show aired Tuesday night at 11:35 p.m. on CBS.  ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

A man looks over a 360Heros drone at the Intel booth during the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, in this file photo taken January 6, 2015.  The long-awaited draft rules from the Federal Aviation Administration would require unmanned aircraft pilots to obtain special pilot certificates, stay away from bystanders and fly only during the day. They limit flying speed to 100 miles per hour (160 kph) and the altitude to 500 feet (152 meters) above ground level.  The rules also say pilots must remain in the line of sight of its radio-control drone, which could limit inspection of pipelines, crops, and electrical towers that are one of the major uses envisioned by companies.  The FAA acknowledged the limitation but said those flights could be made possible with a secondary spotter working with the pilot of the drone.  "This rule does not deal with beyond line of sight, but does allow for the use of a visual observer to augment line of sight by the operator of the unmanned aircraft," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a conference call with reporters on Sunday.  The draft rules, nearly 10 years in the making, still must undergo public comment and revision before becoming final, a process expected to take at least a year.  If they survive in their current form, they would be unlikely to help Amazon.com in its quest to eventually deliver packages with unmanned drones, since they require an FAA-certified small drone pilot to fly the aircraft and keep it in line of sight at all times - factors not envisioned in the online retailer's plan.  Huerta also said, "We don't consider or contemplate in this rule carrying packages outside of the aircraft itself."  Amazon's vice president of global public policy, Paul Misener, said the proposal would bar the company's delivery drones in the United States. Misener also urged the FAA to address the needs of Amazon and its customers as it carried out its formal rulemaking process.  "We are committed to realizing our vision ... and are prepared to deploy where we have the regulatory support we need," Misener said in an emailed statement.  Other countries have taken a more permissive stance towards delivery drones. In September, logistics firm DHL said its use of drones to drop off packages to residents of a German island was the first such authorized flight in Europe.  "The United States cannot afford to lag behind other countries in technological innovation because of regulatory foot-dragging," U.S. Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said in an emailed statement.  Huerta, who said the agency had tried to be "flexible" in writing the rules, said they set a framework and would evolve based on discussions with industry and technology developments.  The rules continue current restrictions against filming of crowds by news organizations, but Huerta said he expected those procedures to be developed as part of discussions with news groups.  Separately, President Barack Obama issued a memo outlining principles for government use of drones, covering such issues as privacy protections and oversight of federal drone use.  The FAA's draft rules appeared less onerous in some aspects than the industry had been worried about. There had been concern, for example, that they would require drone operators to attend a flight-training school and obtain a certification similar to that of a manned aircraft pilot.  Commercial drone operators would need to be at least 17 years old, pass an aeronautical knowledge test and be vetted by the Transportation Security Administration. But they would not need to undergo the medical tests or flight hours required of manned aircraft pilots.  "I am very pleased to see a much more reasonable approach to future regulation than many feared," said Brendan Schulman, a lawyer who works on drone issues at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York.  The proposal would benefit U.S. farmers and ranchers as it would enable them to scout fields more efficiently, said R.J. Karney, director of Congressional relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation.  The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), also praised the draft. The group's president, Brian Wynne, called it a "good first step in an evolutionary process."  But privacy advocates were concerned there were not enough limits on when law enforcement agencies would be permitted to use drones for surveillance.  The proposal "allows the use of data gathered by domestic drones for any 'authorized purpose', which is not defined, leaving the door open to inappropriate drone use by federal agencies," said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the Washington legislative office of the American Civil Liberties Union, in an emailed statement.

Forty-three Democratic leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire signed letters Wednesday morning urging Massachusetts Sen.

The letters were put together by the “Run Warren Run” campaign, which is a joint project of the progressive activist groups MoveOn.org and Democracy for America.  The New Hampshire letter was signed by 27 current or former members of the state House of Representatives and state Senate.  “The Granite State’s grassroots activists, the same friends and neighbors who knocked on doors and made phone calls to send us to Concord, want hear from Senator Warren in 2016, so we’re standing up to make sure their voices are heard,” said state Rep. Renny Cushing.  The 16 signers of the Iowa letter include the Democratic Party chairs or co-chairs of eight different counties as well as the neighborhood of East Des Moines.  The letter was also signed by a supervisor and party central committee members in Johnson County, where college-town Iowa City and the University of Iowa are located. Iowa City provided a major boost to Barack Obama in his caucus victory over Clinton in 2008.

"However this turns out, this problem is being exacerbated by the lack of answers from the Clinton campaign, or the nascent campaign, and it would be good to get out there and answer these questions," he said.  In particular, Axelrod said, Clinton should have already addressed questions, including: “Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?”  “By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful,” he said.  Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that Clinton used only a personal email account for official correspondence during her tenure as secretary of state. And the account she was using, according to the Associated Press, was set up on a private computer server system made only for her that was based in her residence in Chappaqua, N.Y.  Clinton, who has not formally launched a 2016 campaign, has been criticized not only about the allegations but for her failure to respond quickly and vigorously.  In particular, critics have noted that Clinton could have benefited from having a “rapid-response” team in place, as many political campaigns do, to answer the reports.

"That's not unusual for me disagreeing with Mr. Paul," O'Reilly said.  The conservative host also called Paul's stance on terrorism and Iran "naïve," reprising previous comments that Paul's foreign policy views would hurt him in an eventual GOP primary.  Paul opposes the GOP-led effort to impose additional sanctions on Iran in an attempt to pressure the Iranians to give up their nuclear program.  "Sen. Paul loses traction because he has no plan to defeat the jihad and he comes across, maybe he's not that way, it comes across as kind of let them do what they want to do as long as they're not in the U.S.A.," O'Reilly said Tuesday.  Paul declined to appear on the show Tuesday, O'Reilly said, adding to a string of refusals to appear on the program apparently stemming from O'Reilly's criticism of the senator's foreign policy views.  O'Reilly attacked Paul last summer for flipping his position on Israel and denying that he ever wanted to cut foreign aid to Israel. Paul has beefed up his support for Israel and shied away from his isolationist foreign policy views as he began seriously considering a presidential run.  "Rand Paul is going to be hurt by his foreign policy," O'Reilly said during a previous show.  O'Reilly also suggested that Paul's father, former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, is becoming "increasingly radical." 
id=125682, title=Chicago's Black Voters Key As Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia Battles To Defeat Rahm Emanuel In Mayoral Race, url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/02/chicago-mayor-race_n_6782472.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics, datepublished=2015-03-02 13:00:00, date=2015-03-02 15:13:35.512000, datesaved=2015-03-02 15:13:35.512000, text=By Mary Wisniewski and Tracy Rucinski   CHICAGO, March 2 (Reuters) - Winning more support from Chicago's black community, which makes up about one third of the electorate, will be essential if Jesus "Chuy" Garcia is to cause one of the biggest political upsets of recent years by defeating incumbent Rahm Emanuel in a run-off and become Chicago's first Hispanic mayor.   He will need to overcome tensions between the black and Hispanic communities in the city, aggravated under the 22-year term of Mayor Richard M. Daley, which ended in 2011. There was a widespread perception in the black community that Hispanic supporters of Daley were favored in getting city jobs.   But while in 2011 majority African-American wards gave overwhelming backing to Emanuel, who was previously President Barack Obama's chief of staff, some disillusionment has set in since. A persistently high crime rate, the decision to close 50 schools in mostly poor areas, and a sense that Emanuel is out of touch with the community and its problems has hurt him among black voters, some political activists say.   After spending more than $7 million on television ads alone, Emanuel won 45.5 percent of the vote in the first round last Tuesday - the largest tally of the five contenders but short of the 50 percent plus one vote needed to avoid an April 7 run-off.   Garcia, a soft-spoken 58-year-old Mexican immigrant and county commissioner, who raised less than $1.5 million and only bought TV ads in February, came in with 33.6 percent of the vote.   Emanuel's backing in predominantly black wards slipped to just 42 percent, from about 59 percent in 2011, according to the Illinois Election Data web site, while Garcia had 26 percent of the votes. The other 32 percent in those wards went to the three other candidates - two blacks and one white - who have now been eliminated from the race, leaving those votes up for grabs.   Emanuel has stronger support in majority-white wards, with 52 percent, which is the same level that Garcia received in majority-Hispanic wards.   In his bid for re-election, Emanuel has stressed that he is the only candidate who can make tough decisions to rein in the city's budget deficit, expected to grow to $1.2 billion by next year, and deal with massive unfunded pension obligations for city workers. Garcia has criticized Emanuel's authoritarian style, and said that while he knows sacrifices are needed he would listen to residents before making controversial cuts.     WASHINGTON'S COALITION   Chicago is a city where racial politics tend to spell out the calculus of victory, especially given the three major ethnic groups each have roughly the same number of votes.   There are, though, plenty of complexities - for example, the Hispanic vote includes people with various countries of origin, particularly Mexico and Puerto Rico. About 5.5 percent of the population is of Asian descent.   In Chicago, building an African-American and Hispanic coalition is no easy task. A "black-brown" coalition formed under the city's first black mayor, Harold Washington, in the early 1980s, but was never solid and fell apart after Washington's death in 1987, said Delmarie Cobb, an African-American political consultant.   The resentment among blacks that was built up under Daley's rule persists today, Cobb noted.   "Now, there's even more of a feeling of us versus them," Cobb said. "That's what Jesus has to overcome."   Emanuel does have powerful allies among African-American and Hispanic leaders, including Obama and Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez, who said after Tuesday's election Emanuel was "well-positioned" to win the run-off.   "Rahm's campaign is about making Chicago better for all Chicagoans - from every neighborhood, background and family, and he's making his vision for one strong Chicago clear everywhere he goes," said Emanuel campaign spokesman Steve Mayberry, when asked about support in black and Hispanic wards. He cited in particular the mayor's push for a higher minimum wage, and initiatives to expand a kindergarten program and to make community college places more accessible.   Garcia must convince residents of all ethnicities that he is a viable politician to run the city and not just a protest candidate used to send a warning to Emanuel, political strategists said.   He must also get more of the vote out - overall turnout for all voters was 33.6 percent last Tuesday.   "If Chuy can win this race, it's because he can put together all these different groups who aren't talking with each other as much as they should be," said Kevin Lampe, a political consultant. "He has to build a new coalition."     BRIDGING THE GAP   Garcia does have some major supporters within the black community.   He has, for example, the backing from Karen Lewis, the charismatic black president of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union. Lewis had planned a run against Emanuel herself but backed out after being diagnosed with a brain tumor, and then threw her weight behind Garcia.   Jonathan Todd, a black community activist, said Garcia's ethnicity may have hurt him among some blacks. "We have to find a way to bridge that racial gap," said Todd, who supports Garcia.   Despite his small campaign fund, Garcia has much positive momentum, said political strategist Vince Casillas, Obama's Spanish-language press secretary in 2008, who has friends on both sides. One thing that will help is if Lewis campaigns for him, said Casillas. Another strategy would be to organize in areas where schools were closed.   Cobb said that in the black community, Garcia needs to point to both his alliance with Mayor Washington, and his current job as floor leader for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, another powerful black politician.   Tamika Ford, 33, an African-American shop assistant who graduated from one of the shuttered public schools, said Garcia's ethnicity doesn't matter to her.   "Chuy could probably change things up a little," said Ford. "Obama did it so why not Chuy? He's from a different culture and he's looking out for all cultures, not just one side."

Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) recently sent such a letter to Department of Labor (DOL) Secretary Thomas Perez. The subject was DOL's efforts to strengthen protections for retirement savers by closing loopholes in a rule that requires advisers to act in their customers' interests instead of their own.  The revised rule proposal is reportedly set to go to OMB for review, the final step before being issued for public comment. When it publishes the rule for comment, DOL has promised to include both guidance on how it would be implemented (known as "prohibited transaction exemptions" or PTEs) and an extensive economic analysis showing the harm to retirement savers that demands a regulatory response. Financial services firms and their lobbyists have vowed to kill the rule, preferably before it and the accompanying economic analysis ever see the light of day.  At the top of the Johnson letter's list of questions is one seeking assurances that the rule won't "adversely affect middle and low-income Americans." This is taken straight from industry talking points. Since this concern over middle-class access is a phony claim based on a false premise about the DOL's expected regulatory approach, it should be a breeze for Secretary Perez to answer. After all, DOL officials have already answered it many times before.  Or we could just wait until DOL puts the rule out for public comment. Then we could all judge for ourselves whether it meets DOL's promise to provide flexibility for financial firms and strengthened protections for retirement savers. But, of course, a debate on the facts is precisely what financial firms are trying to avoid.

President Obama, with two speeches in as many days, has decided to take the battle to his conservative critics.  Those who identify the black-clad extremists with their religious roots, the commander-in-chief argued repeatedly, are peddling a “lie” that will drive recruitment by the nation’s enemies and ultimately hurt U.S. interests. “These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy. And all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam, because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorists’ narrative,” he said, using the U.S. government’s preferred acronym for the Islamic State.  But he did not stop there. A day after talking about the “debate in the press and among pundits” over terminology, he accused others in the public sphere Thursday of aiding the terrorist cause by highlighting the connection between Islamic teachings and Islamic State’s tactics, which include rape, beheadings, crucifixions and slavery. “That narrative sometimes extends far beyond terrorist organizations,” he continued. “That narrative becomes the foundation upon which terrorists build their ideology and by which they try to justify their violence, and that hurts all of us, including Islam and especially Muslims who are the ones most likely to be killed.”  On the other side are conservative commenters and Republican Presidential contenders, who have argued Obama has weakened the international effort to defeat the radicals by whitewashing their religious roots in public statements. “I think it’s a mistake to think that ISIS is not what it is,” said Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush, using another acronym for the Islamic State, after a foreign policy address on Wednesday. “It’s violent, extreme Islamic terrorism, and the more we try to ignore that reality, the less likely it is that we’re going to develop the appropriate strategy to garner the support in the Muslim world to do what I said, which is tighten the noose and then take them out.”  Neither side shows much interest in backing down, making this a seminal moment in the Obama Administration’s long battle against the conservative press and his Republican critics. With the exception of his political campaigns and the debate over health care reform, White House aides have mostly preferred to be dismissive, not confrontational, when faced with the rhetoric of the right. But in this case, the White House has concluded that the rhetoric could have a real impact on the strength of the nation’s military foe.  Conservatives are unbowed by this claim, just a week before a major gathering in Washington of conservative leaders, where the red-meat rhetoric is certain to fly freely. A day after Obama’s first speech, the cover of the conservative New York Post photoshopped a blindfold on the President’s portrait with the headline, “Islamic terror? I just don’t see it.” Just two days earlier, Bill O’Reilly, the popular Fox News anchor, upped the temperature by declaring on his show “The Holy War is here, and unfortunately it seems the president will be the last to acknowledge it” — the exact frame that Obama argues validates the Islamic State cause.  Many of the Republicans presidential contenders have also embraced this critique of Obama’s approach to the Islamic State, even as they have offered little detail on how they would prosecute the military campaign differently. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called Obama “an apologist for radical Islamic terrorists,” on Fox News Wednesday night.  “Everything he does is against what Christians stand for, and he’s against the Jews in Israel,” former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said earlier this month on “Fox and Friends.” “The one group of people that can know they have his undying, unfailing support would be the Muslim community. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the radical Muslim community or the more moderate Muslim community.”  Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, another likely candidate for President, criticized Obama earlier this month for his choice of words. “He certainly doesn’t like to say radical Islamic,” Jindal said in another Fox News appearance. “There’s a politically correct crowd that jumps on you when you say that.” Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tweeted a link to a poll showing concern about Obama’s handling of the Islamic State. “We should call it what it is: radical Islamic terrorism,” Walker wrote.  Obama’s efforts to separate the ideology of extremists from the underlying teachings of Islam are a long-held strategy of the U.S. Government. In the immediate wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, then-President George W. Bush, who used the term “Islamic extremist,” spoke repeatedly about the difference between Islam and the efforts of Al Qaeda. “These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith, and it’s important for my fellow Americans to understand that,” Bush said, as the rubble in lower Manhattan still smoldered. “The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don’t represent peace. They represent evil and war.”  Some conservative and evangelical activists, however, have since rejected that formulation. In a recent email to supporters, David Lane, a Christian political organizer at the American Renewal Project, who has led trips overseas with many Republican leaders, including Rick Perry, Rand Paul, Huckabee and members of the Republican National Committee, wrote that George W. Bush was mistaken when he claimed in 2004 that Christians and Muslims worshiped the same deity. “The denial of the existence of evil, that God actually has enemies, is part of the fallout of a Biblically illiterate nation,” Lane wrote. “Our previous president was conned.” 
id=212354, title=This District Is Trying To Improve Student Achievement By Making Kids Feel Good About Themselves, url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/08/howard-county-schools-gallup_n_7027234.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics, datepublished=2015-04-08 23:01:42, date=2015-04-08 23:41:56.606000, datesaved=2015-04-08 23:41:56.606000, text=Students who distract peers with stories and jokes aren’t labeled “class clowns” at Ducketts Lane Elementary School in Maryland. Instead, they’re lauded for having “presence.”  And when parents and students meet with teachers to discuss student progress, teachers rarely focus on students’ deficiencies. Instead, they discuss the students' major strengths and how they could work to grow those strengths.  For nearly two years, this elementary school in the Howard County Public School System has been participating in a districtwide initiative designed to highlight the personality strengths of students and teachers. The initiative is part of a partnership with Gallup that began in 2013 to boost student and teacher strengths and engagement. Preliminary results show the approach seems to be working so far.  “You can see the confidence in the kids,” said Rachel Edoho-Eket, a Kindergarten Instructional Team Leader at Ducketts Lane. “If you were to ask a fourth- or fifth-grader, ‘What are your top strengths,’ they would be able to recite it. If you were to ask me when I was that age, I’d be like, ‘I’m nice and uhhh….”  Ducketts Elementary school is one of six “model” elementary schools in the Howard County school district, a suburban district that serves over 50,000 students K-12. The fruits of the Gallup partnership are present throughout all of the district’s 76 schools, but most fully integrated into its model schools, which pilot new initiatives.  As part of this effort, HCPSS gives all employees and students in grades five through 12 surveys to measure their levels of engagement each year. All district teachers and students in select grades at model schools are also given tests that identify their personality strengths. Once these strengths are identified, it is the job of strengths specialists –- who are employees at the district but trained by Gallup -- to help administrators and teachers find ways to build upon these talents.  The idea is that if staff and students feel recognized for their strong points, they will feel more engaged at school. When students feel more engaged at school, their academics improve, Gallup research shows. When teachers feel more engaged at school, they are more likely to thrive at their jobs.  “School improvement used to be: Here are our standardized test scores, what are we going to do to move kids? Now the process is much more dynamic,” said Rebecca Amani-Dove, communications director for the Howard County Public School System. “There’s not just a focus on academics … [there’s focus] on the well-being of staff and organization."  Between 2013 and 2014, average levels of staff engagement increased from 34 percent to 40 percent. Engagement levels of students hovered around 54 percent both years.  Teachers and support staff have embraced the new emphasis on strengths development, even if there was some pushback at first, said Lisa Boarman, coordinator of school counseling for the district.  “There were a few [teachers] who were skeptical, like, 'Who’s going to see my results?'” said Boarman, who has been trained as a strengths specialist. Some staff members were also worried it would reflect poorly upon them if they weren’t shown to possess certain strengths, she said.  Overall, though, Boarman says she thinks the strengths development process has helped improve staff engagement, albeit not overnight.  “Some people have posted their strengths in the signature line of their email,” said Boarman. “The biggest thing for me is how this process drives employee engagement. If I get to go to work and do what I do best every day and utilize my strengths, I’m going to go home and feel good.”  At model schools, students have also embraced this new approach, said Edoho-Eket. Teachers wear lanyards that present their top five strengths. Fourth- and fifth-graders have their strengths displayed on their desks.     A HCPSS teacher sports a lanyard with her top five strengths. Credit: Terry McClung  “It’s nice when you have information about yourself that you can latch onto,” said Edoho-Eket, whose personality test describes her as a maximizer (“by nature I look at other people's strengths around me”), an arranger (“I like to organize and plan but I have a flexibility piece”) and a communicator (“I love to write and do presentations”).  Schools have also developed specific engagement strategies as a result of their Gallup survey results. At Ducketts Lane, leaders are working to help staff and students feel more recognized.  “You’re going to find some schools where you’ve got the right leadership and teachers feel supported and students feel like they’ve got a lot of options and people are working with them,” said Connie Rath, vice chair of Gallup Education. “There are other schools where it’s a pretty different story.”  She continued, “[HCPSS leaders are] paying a lot more attention to the type of culture they want and what they want to see for students in the future.”

id=137225, title=How a Mid-Sized Tennessee Town Took on Comcast\, Revived Its Economy\, and Did it With Socialism, url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-gibson/chattanooga-socialism_b_6812368.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics, datepublished=2015-03-06 21:36:47, date=2015-03-06 21:56:27.863000, datesaved=2015-03-06 21:56:27.863000, text=Chattanooga, Tennessee, has provided a model for all American towns who want to see their economies and populations grow quickly. And that model is simple: give sub-par internet providers like Comcast some legitimate competition with publicly-owned municipal broadband networks.  "People understand that high-speed Internet access is quickly becoming a national infrastructure issue just like the highways were in the 1950s," Chattanooga mayor Andy Berke told CNN Money. "If the private sector is unable to provide that kind of bandwidth because of the steep infrastructure investment, then just like highways in the 1950s, the government has to consider providing that support."  If you're sick of having only one cable/internet company in your town and have horror stories about dealing with a global corporation that has a monopoly and doesn't care about you, you aren't the only one. According to a 2011 survey by the FCC, 61 percent of Americans have only one cable and internet provider to choose from. And in 2012, Comcast and Time Warner both ranked in the top ten most hated companies. Comcast even took home Consumerist's grand prize of Worst Company in America in 2010 and 2014. This call between an exasperated Comcast customer just trying to cancel his service and a Comcast rep insisting that he keep the service he doesn't want captures how a lot of Americans feel about monopoly cable providers like Comcast.  Even after the FCC voted to uphold net neutrality and classify internet as a public utility, it's still expected that Comcast's proposed merger with Time Warner will be approved by the end of this month, with "company-specific" regulations. This would likely mean that most Americans, who either only have Comcast or Time Warner cable in their area, will be stuck dealing with the same company that treats them like dirt. 74 percent of Americans surveyed by the Consumer Reports National Research Center feared higher prices, and 66 percent feared poorer customer service. And as the potential Comcast-Time Warner megacorporation is allowed to grow larger, expect it to gobble up the smaller remaining cable providers to become the only game in town for the rest of America.  However, by providing municipal broadband internet to residents, Chattanooga, Tennessee, has shown America the best way to beat back Comcast, even if the merger goes through.  In 2008, Chattanooga formed the Electric Power Board, which is a public utility company owned by the city's taxpayers. The EPB got right to work building a "smart grid" to better service the city's power needs in the event of outages, and to provide super-fast, fiber-optic internet to everyone in the city, which launched in September of 2009. Since its launch, the EPB's network has proven to be 50 times faster than the average American's internet connection, delivering 1 gigabit of information per second. A 2-hour video that normally takes 25 minutes to download on a regular broadband network would only take 33 seconds to download on Chattanooga's network. And like other cable providers, EPB offers TV, internet, and phone service as a bundle, and for less than Comcast charges.  Naturally, Comcast and other privately-owned cable companies tried to sue Chattanooga for daring to compete with them. But with the help of a $111 million grant from President Obama's federal stimulus package, The EPB was formed out of necessity -- city officials figured that if Comcast was the only game in town, they would have little incentive to invest money in beefing up its infrastructure to provide reliable service and faster internet to customers. In fact, Verizon FiOs already said it would stop building out its network in 2013.  "It just didn't look like the private sector was going to bring true, high-speed connectivity to this market," EPB spokeswoman Danna Bailey told CNN Money.  Now, Chattanooga's investment in fast internet infrastructure is paying big economic dividends. NerdWallet rated Chattanooga the 6th best city for economic growth for 2009 to 2012, the years immediately following its decision to invest in high-speed public broadband network. In that same time frame, median household income in Chattanooga grew by 13.5 percent and home values increased by 14 percent. This growth happened despite cruel austerity measures imposed by Tennessee's right-wing state government that resulted in roughly 3,000 jobs lost in the government and construction sectors. However, new businesses are rapidly locating to Chattanooga, eager to capitalize on the fastest internet in the United States.  Volkswagen opened a new plant in Chattanooga in 2011, and recently added an SUV line to the factory, creating another 2,000 jobs. Claris Networks, an 85-person company, moved its data center from Knoxville to Chattanooga "just because of the network," according to company representative Hunter Lindsay in CNN Money. The New York Times mentions how Toni Gemayel, owner of a software startup in Tampa, moved his company to Chattanooga after the rollout of the high-speed municipal network. QuickCue, a company that began in Chattanooga in 2011 to help restaurants digitize their processes, grew so successful that OpenTable, a similar company with a larger market share, bought it for $11 million in 2013.  Chattanooga's EPB didn't cut have to cut out Comcast and impose its own monopoly -- it's simply beating them with faster internet and superior customer service. Online reviews for the two companies in Chattanooga speak for themselves. Comcast's services in Chattanooga have an average rating of one star on Yelp. However, Google reviews of EPB's services are overwhelmingly positive.  "The product itself is very poor. Internet is spotty and unreliable, to say the least. We regularly clocked download speeds of 3 MB/second...agonizingly slow," Rusty W. wrote in a 1-star Yelp review of Comcast's Chattanooga services in January of 2014. "I'm nominating Comcast for the Worst "Customer Service" in the history of customer service award. Zero respect for their customers' time... I could go on and on, but Comcast offers the best punch line. Their advertising campaign says "Don't fall for EPB!" What a joke. Just try Comcast. You won't "fall" for EPB, you'll RUN to EPB!"  "Never going to back comcast. Only ever written about 2 reviews in my life but sooo happy with EPB I had to!" wrote Jen T. in a 5-star Google review of EPB's services in July of 2014. "Customer service is super helpful (and local)."  "EPB puts At&t and Comcast to shame. Once you switch you will never go back," wrote Kyle Simpson in another 5-star review of Chattanooga's public internet provider last August. "If EPB doubled their rates and the other guys offered service for free, EPB would still be the better value."  "Never going back to Comcast! Have had my net connection through epb for 2 years and have never had a outage," Robert Bell wrote in March of 2013. He also gave the company 5 stars.  What's already a reality for Chattanooga may become a reality for more cities and towns in the coming years -- the FCC recently overturned local laws in North Carolina and Tennessee, lobbied for by big cable companies, that make it harder for municipalities to create their own broadband networks. Chattanooga has proven to everyone else that having a public option for internet, cable, and phone service is better for consumers. And though the big companies would never admit it, the competition that socialist local broadband networks provide is the heart of the free-market capitalism they claim to espouse.

The still-unidentified government employee turned himself in to authorities after seeing news reports about the crash, which triggered a lockdown at the White House and nearby government buildings.  The Times reported the man had a feeling the drone might have touched down on the White House grounds, but he went home to sleep regardless.  While this particular remote-controlled aircraft posed little risk to the President or others, the event caused concern that similar drones could represent a national security threat.  President Obama himself used the incident to call for a new regulatory framework around small unmanned aircraft. Some Federal Aviation Administration rules apply to small, hobbyist-piloted drones, but the agency lacks an effective enforcement mechanism to punish offenders, largely leaving local law enforcement to sanction pilots who put the public’s safety at risk.  Judging by a Secret Service photo released Monday, the drone was a DJI Phantom, which are about two pounds and just over a foot across and retail for $479 and up:  Many Phantom models are capable of carrying a video camera, but it wasn’t clear from the image if the unit in question was equipped with one.

They're merely rivalrous siblings, with the same murderous objectives--the control not only of Islam but of the world in general. But Netanyahu's idea is interesting in an almost Halachic way, to the extent that it turns over obvious assumptions. Perhaps we have been lulled to sleep by the Sunni and Shiite conflict. The Nazis and Russians were enemies until they signed Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of l939. Of course they would become enemies again. It's comforting to think of Iran as our silent and strategic partner in the Mideast due to the conflict with the Sunnis. Netanyahu's point is that the US and Iran are strange bedfellows, maybe like Norman and Marion in Psycho. Will the animosity between Sunnis and Shiites take precedence over the conflicts with the West? Amidst all the threat of terrorism there has been a comfort in imagining a strong Iran as a bulwark against what has seemed like the far more threatening extremism of both al-Qaeda and ISIS. And Netanyahu's speech gives little credit to the huge divide between Iran and other countries in the Middle East. Iran's relatively cosmopolitan society and culture is a far cry from Syria, Iraq and it's certainly Egypt. Still two negatives don't necessarily makes a positive. How many times have we armed insurgent forces only to find our own weapons eventually being used against us?  {This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}

They have said that she is the “hottest commodity” in the Democratic Party and that she has demonstrated the “passion and intensity” that Hillary Rodham Clinton lacks.  Those glowing compliments are not from the liberal activists who are trying to persuade Ms. Warren to challenge Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to be the party’s leading contender in 2016. They come from conservatives who are eager to drum up a contentious Democratic primary and who see Ms. Warren, a first-term senator from Massachusetts, as best positioned to weaken, and potentially defeat, Mrs. Clinton.  On cable television and in private strategy sessions, conservatives are steadily stoking the flames of a movement to recruit Ms. Warren, who has said she will not run but whose anti-Wall Street economic message resonates with the liberal base of the Democratic Party.  “Please give us Elizabeth Warren. Please, God, let us have Elizabeth Warren,” said Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who is considering a presidential bid.  “I respect her because she has the courage to speak her convictions,” Mr. Huckabee said on Fox News.  Former Representative Michele Bachmann, a Tea Party Republican from Minnesota, told CNN that Ms. Warren would be “an extremely attractive candidate.” Mrs. Bachmann also said that if she were Mrs. Clinton, she would be “extremely concerned.”  The tactic says much about the 2016 landscape for Republicans. A crowded field of people who say they are considering running for president — including Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts — has emerged. That means the party is expecting a bruising ideological battle for the nomination.  Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and 2008 presidential candidate, could emerge from the primary season relatively unscathed. Other Democrats — including Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont — may also run, but at this early stage none is expected to have the funding or political apparatus to pose a serious threat to Mrs. Clinton.  An easy path to the nomination would allow Mrs. Clinton to potentially enter a general election with more funding than the Republican nominee, who would have had to spend heavily to beat a wide field of competitors. Ms. Warren represents Republicans’ best hope for an expensive, prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination, weakening Mrs. Clinton along the way, political operatives on both sides say.  That desire appears to trump the fact that Ms. Warren’s views about taxation, regulation and the role of government are so at odds with Republican tenets. “There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own,” she famously said in 2011.  Ms. Warren told Fortune magazine this month that she would not run to succeed President Obama, but that has not stopped speculation.  “Elizabeth Warren says, ‘I’m not running, I don’t want to be president,’ ” the radio host Rush Limbaugh said recently. “Translation: ‘I can’t wait and I am running. But I’m just not going to admit it right now.’ ”  Republicans said Ms. Warren would deliver a perfect “trifecta” in diminishing Mrs. Clinton. She attracts young, liberal supporters who view Mrs. Clinton as too centrist. A Warren candidacy would take away a central theme expected of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign — that it is time to elect a female president. And Ms. Warren’s presence in the primary season could push Mrs. Clinton to adopt liberal positions that might turn off independents in a general election.  It first became apparent that Ms. Warren could be an effective tool in moving Mrs. Clinton off message when the two appeared at a joint rally in October for Martha Coakley, the Democratic nominee for governor of Massachusetts.  In her speech, Mrs. Clinton tried to channel some of Ms. Warren’s populist zeal, but flubbed a variation of the senator’s controversial line about the roots of success. “Don’t let anybody tell you that, you know, it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs,” Mrs. Clinton said.  She later said she had misspoken and was referring to certain tax policies that stifle job creation, but Republicans had already pounced, portraying the comment as evidence that Mrs. Clinton was pandering to liberal voters.  “You could just see it gets in Secretary Clinton’s head when she has to compare herself vis-à-vis Senator Warren,” said Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, a conservative “super PAC.” He added, “From that perspective, a food fight could be good.”  R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor in chief of The American Spectator and a longtime critic of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, said her comment in Massachusetts could help inform younger voters about how she shifts opinions based on what is popular. “She pulled a line from Obama and Elizabeth Warren to try to make a very au courant crony-capitalist or socialist statement,” Mr. Tyrrell said.  At the same time, a groundswell of support for Ms. Warren among liberal activists has aided Republicans’ behind-the-scenes efforts.  In December, the liberal group MoveOn.org said it would spend $1 million on a campaign to draft Ms. Warren into the 2016 race.  MoveOn.org and Democracy for America jointly run a website called “Run Warren Run,” which has signed up more than 245,000 supporters. The groups plan to host “Run Warren Run” house parties this weekend in 100 locations across the country.  Liberals cheered Ms. Warren this month after Antonio Weiss, a Wall Street banker whom Mr. Obama had picked as a Treasury Department official, eliciting vehement objections from Ms. Warren, asked Mr. Obama to rescind his nomination.  Ms. Warren is still largely unknown even in Iowa, where the draft-Warren movement has focused its efforts. In of likely Democratic caucus goers conducted in early October by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, 44 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, compared with 76 percent for Mrs. Clinton.  While many Republicans are engaging in mischief as they promote Ms. Warren, some of her populist positions resonate across the political aisle. During debates over the Wall Street bailout, Ms. Warren and Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, often agreed on objections to parts of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and in their criticism of former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.  “It was almost like the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” Kurt Bardella, a former spokesman for Mr. Issa, said. The tendency for Republicans to align with Ms. Warren is particularly strong among those who emphasize libertarianism.  Brian Darling, a senior aide to Mr. Paul, said he would like to see a 2016 general election between Ms. Warren and the Kentucky senator to hear the fresh ideas that the matchup might yield.  “She hates Wall Street for a very different reason than libertarians,” Mr. Darling said. “Yet they both would agree that the bailouts of Wall Street were a gaming of the system.”  Tucker Carlson, a libertarian political pundit, said Ms. Warren has an authenticity that resonates with both sides. “She has this spark of genuine ideological fervor, and I mean that as a compliment,” he said. “It’s not just pure opportunism.”  Ms. Warren, of course, has given the anti-Clinton movement plenty of fodder. She frequently says that income inequality is due, in part, to the economic and trade policies of President Bill Clinton. In her 2003 book, “The Two-Income Trap,” written with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, Ms. Warren accused Mrs. Clinton of snapping at her staff and of shifting her position on bankruptcy legislation when she became a New York senator in order to appease her Wall Street donors.  “As New York’s newest senator, however, it seems that Hillary Clinton could not afford such a principled position,” Ms. Warren wrote. Republicans could not have said it better themselves.

The protections had been instituted by then-Govenor and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat whose 2007 order established “protected class rights” that prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  Brownback, a Republican, signed a second executive order reaffirming the state’s commitment to bar employment discrimination on the basis of “race, color, gender, religion, national origin, ancestry or age.”  “This Executive Order ensures that state employees enjoy the same civil rights as all Kansans without creating additional ‘protected classes’ as the previous order did,” Brownback said in a statement. “Any such expansion of ‘protected classes’ should be done by the legislature and not through unilateral action.”  Democrats spoke out against the new order’s reversal on LGBT rights, while state Republicans had mixed reactions. Tom Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas, told the Kansas City Star that the move was “an outrage.”  “Gay, lesbian, and transgender state employees across Kansas have trusted they would be safe from discrimination and harassment in their workplace,” he said, “but Sam Brownback has, by erasing their job protections, declared ‘open season’ on every one of them.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — How much will President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama interact during the National Prayer Breakfast? Heaven only knows.  Obama is to sit at the head table Thursday morning with other speakers. Event organizers say the spiritual leader of Tibet will be seated in the audience of about 3,600, near the dais and his friend, actor Richard Gere.  With such close proximity, a chance encounter is possible between Obama and the Dalai Lama. But the White House says there is no specific meeting between the fellow Nobel Peace Prize winners to announce.  The event is drawing protests from China. Beijing considers the Dalai Lama an anti-Chinese separatist because of his quest for greater Tibetan autonomy.

The bill overwhelmingly passed 392-37, a rare moment of bipartisanship for a Congress accustomed to little action.  "If someone came down from Mars today, into this chamber, they'd be shocked at this camaraderie," said Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.). "This is great. You've got to admit, this is a good feeling."  The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 has a little something for everyone. Both parties have been eager to tackle the issue at the core of the legislation: a permanent replacement for the so-called Medicare "doc fix," an annual vote to stave off cuts to the rates that doctors get paid by Medicare. The new bill instead will offer gradual raises to doctors. Democrats like the bill's plan to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program for two years. Republicans like its $70 billion offset, which stems from structural changes to Medicare, like requiring high-income seniors to pay more and reducing spending on Medigap plans.  Lawmakers seemed as happy as they did surprised that they could do something so important.  "This has been an incredible week," said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). "First, Ted Cruz signs up for Obamacare. Now we have this bipartisan compromise on the doc fix, it reauthorizes CHIP and provides money to our community health centers. Who knows, if this is contagious, maybe next week we'll deal with climate change."  "I would say to the American people, don't look now but we are actually governing," said Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.). "Imagine where we'll be in a year from today, when we're not trying to come up with another $1 billion Band-Aid."  The bill already has President Barack Obama's blessing, but the remaining challenge is how, and when, it gets through the Senate. Democrats there are unhappy with some of its details and not sure whether they'll support it. Republican leaders have also been quiet on the bill, though some key GOP legislators have publicly embraced it.  "I can't imagine another bipartisan opportunity like this coming around again anytime soon," Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said Wednesday. "Anyone who thinks we can continue to put this off, to wait around for that perfect bill to come together, is fooling themselves."  Time is short. The current "doc fix" expires on March 31, which means doctors will start being hit with a 20 percent payment cut from Medicare if the Senate doesn't act. Add to the mix that Congress is going into recess on Friday for two weeks, and the Senate is already booked up all day and all night Thursday with a budget debate.  The Senate has two choices: either unanimously agree to pass the House bill late Thursday, or punt it to when they come back in mid-April. That would mean Congress blows the March 31 deadline, but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has in the past found ways to avoid immediate cuts to doctors' payments.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hinted Thursday that she expected the Senate to pass the bill before leaving town. "I believe this will move," she told reporters.  But Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said on the Senate floor that he hasn't agreed to a timeline for moving the bill before the recess, which leaves its timing up in the air.
